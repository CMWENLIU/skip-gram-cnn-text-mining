an irish athletics year wo n t be remembered as one of irish athletics great years the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad but come late august a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics or to be more accurate the lack of it sonia o sullivan s olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers but after the disastrous build up to the games we should n t have been surprised at the start of the year an o sullivan had been earmarked as ireland s best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury less than a week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo lombard s shattering of mark carroll s national m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two year ban from the sport back at pre olympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things could n t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens once the track and field action began in athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg s performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the m final did offer hope for the future our beloved sonia scraped into the women s k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake up as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world class field at the flora lite k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over it s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition at least sonia managed to make it to athens at the start of the year several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an out of form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of and an early exit james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane the injury plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the m qualifying mark but was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckee s athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury ravaged years donnelly and his annadale striders team mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on december a large turnout of athletics loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy s many friends as only death can it put the year s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective

athens memories soar above lows well it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens obviously there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but i want to remind you of a few more events that made another year to remember or forget for athletics one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the m winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the m would be a bit of a formality kelly had been full of should i should n t i thoughts about going for the double in athens i thought why would n t you do the m it s your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story the victory for the british men s xm relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games i think the four of them jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewis francis knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale he was the first man since for years to win both the m and m titles as soon as he had added the m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the m five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing does n t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people including me purely as a race paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nip and tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you do n t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out kelly and the xm boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the m i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the m and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we do n t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really does n t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special to be honest i m getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on having said that i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it

jones doping probe begins an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee ioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte of balco laboratories jones who says she is innocent could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performance enhancing drugs before the sydney olympics but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that hoping only that the truth will emerge any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc s executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago but world anti doping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now we will find a way to deal with that pound said in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared victor conte s allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward she said conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory inconsistent statements
johnson accuses british sprinters former olympic champion michael johnson has accused britain s top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition at the moment the biggest factor on the mind of british sprinters is to be number one in britain the world m and m record holder told five live athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride however linford christie countered it s easy to criticise when you have n t gone through the system here johnson was involved in a verbal spat with britain s darren campbell earlier this year the american had cast doubt on campbell s claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the olympic m and m finals and the american remains highly critical of aspects of british sprinting the only time you see british sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other he claimed athletes here have to compete more outside the uk their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top british sprinter speaking at an elite coaches conference in birmingham johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in britain it had not necessarily reaped the rewards you ca n t fix everything with money he admitted you contrast the situation here to that of some us athletes who have no funding those who are n t funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging so when they get to the top they are more appreciative
radcliffe proves doubters wrong this wo n t go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula s career but as a test of character it was the toughest race she s ever taken part in a win in the new york marathon does n t make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year if paula s last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future even if she d lost this race there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it she knows she can dig deep if she needs to it was a strong field with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning and although two hours minutes was n t one of paula s best times it was n t far off the record on a difficult course i was speaking to paula in the lead up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no win situation she thought that if she won people would say why could n t she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and m in athens but that was never on the cards she might have been beaten but she would have kept running the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions were n t at play here the only question was what position she could finish in most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paula s mind if she was n t confident she would n t have run after all if you re the best in the world at an event you ll always have expectations of winning now paula will take part in the run london km race in london at the end of the year have a well earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism

radcliffe tackles marathon tasks paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the m bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race the ability to run a gruelling miles relies largely upon an athlete s belief that they can do it every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high profile and emotional circumstances sports psychologist hugh richards says the year old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence there is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you richards told bbc sport paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york win or lose if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled a has been and her profile will suffer and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians she must not get caught up in someone else s agenda radcliffe s best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the year old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york she just thought well they ca n t think any worse of me now yelling told bbc sport she s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have a tick list of personal goals her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption you ca n t change history warned richards only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just days after the athens marathon it s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again said yelling herself a marathon runner but that is only for long term health and fitness when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly so physically it is possible for paula richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens he said and that just is n t going to be there in new york that s been taken out of the equation radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in new york how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not argues richards one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities and yelling says i think this will probably make paula i think it will drive her on and she ll come out of it a better athlete

what now for kelly holmes last april kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the m and m at the olympics it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the year old has repeatedly chosen to tick the do n t know box holmes has now pulled out of this weekend s european indoor championships where she was selected for both the m and m because of a hamstring injury but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well it s a lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty handed but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself will i have as much commitment desire and energy to go through a major championship holmes asked in the new year that is what i do n t know at holmes will also be aware that time is running out us m and m legend michael johnson a five time olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his th birthday as did britain s double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson the physical demands of the day to day grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she does n t like the training anymore whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs the day after completing her double in athens the year old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched should n t they be at least shared and celebrated you do n t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it s a fantastic feeling i think deep down kelly wants to run i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new look kelly holmes tearing up the track again after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire so why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again that s just kelly explains cram she s always been like that she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it s headline news kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line and if she decides not to run again no one is going to turn round and say you re making the wrong decision

european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton s win in the m hurdles running sub eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sunday s performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head to head race will give sarah confidence in the men s race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the men s m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and m hurdles and you ca n t ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it was n t all good news in sheffield i thought both the m races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he was n t at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off day for him he s there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the women s race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two year drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that should n t be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them

record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evening s work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world s top three m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just has n t convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men s m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front runners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark lewis francis could have done in the final if only he had n t got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the false start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is you re meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i have n t seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france s ronald pognon who has run seconds will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxton s victory in the m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women s national m race in a new personal best of seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong xm squad going to the european championships scotland s lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the m but i do n t think the pace making was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year s shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the men s m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly

iaaf will contest greek decision the international association of athletics federations will appeal against the acquittal of greek athletes kostas kenteris and katerina thanou the high profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the greek athletics federation segas last month now the iaaf will lodge an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport cas and has suspended both athletes an iaaf statement said the doping review board concluded that the decision is erroneous the statement continued both athletes cases will be refered to arbitration before the cas the decision in both cases will be final and binding segas said the iaaf appeal was expected and understandable now we are going to await the final result which we cannot prejudge said segas chairman vassilis sevastis kenteris who won olympic m gold at the olympics and thanou were suspended by the iaaf last december after failing to take routine drugs tests before the athens games however the independent tribunal overturned those bans clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify anti doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics kenteris lawyer gregory ioannidis described the iaaf s decision as not unexpected but told bbc sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly the iaaf s timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions said ioannidis the iaaf has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements testimonies the closing speeches of defence counsel and nine audio tapes we have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth kenteris and thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer s olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on august the pair then spent four days in a hospital claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash it was the international olympic committee who demanded the iaaf investigate the affair thanou and kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident
greek duo cleared in doping case sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal the duo had been provisionally suspended by the iaaf for allegedly missing three drugs tests including one on the eve of the athens olympics but the greek athletics federation tribunal has overturned the bans a decision which the iaaf can now contest at the court of arbitration for sport the pair s former coach christos tzekos has been banned for four years kenteris and thanou had been charged with avoiding drug tests in tel aviv chicago and athens and failing to notify anti doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics they withdrew from the olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on august the pair then spent four days in a hospital claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash it was the international olympic committee s demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal the head of that tribunal kostas panagopoulos said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens the charge cannot be substantiated he said in no way was he kenteris informed to appear for a doping test the same goes for thanou kenteris s lawyer gregory ioannidis said the decision means mr kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career he has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in january this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one it shows he has no case to answer mr kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character he has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures but the iaaf said it was very surprised by the verdict spokesman nick davies said we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest our doping review board will now consider the english version of the decision

man city man utd manchester united reduced chelsea s premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city wayne rooney met gary neville s cross to the near post with a low shot which went in via a deflection off richard dunne to put united ahead seven minutes later the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james head and into his own net steve mcmanaman wasted city s best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half in the opening minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance a paul scholes header over the bar and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern only shaun wright phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems wes brown also found wright phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline wright phillips sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin point centre to the feet of mcmanaman but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side footing the easy chance wide john o shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much needed pace into the united attack rooney was being well marshalled by dunne but that was all about to change after the break united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city s best first half chance rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it even if he needed the help of dunne s leg worse was to come for dunne who had been having a fine match on minutes he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney s cross and united seemed home and dry however city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post manchester city boss kevin keegan we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much but we still had four good chances two after we d gone down the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from manchester united boss sir alex ferguson it was n t our best performance of the last three months but i think we re deserved winners at times especially in the first half we did n t play with enough speed but with cristiano ronaldo and ryan giggs on the speed improved derby games can be like that they can be scrappy dull horrible and it was maybe like that man city james mills bradley wright phillips dunne distin thatcher shaun wright phillips barton macken sibierski mcmanaman musampa fowler subs not used weaver onuoha flood booked fowler sibierski man utd carroll gary neville ferdinand brown heinze o shea ronaldo keane fortune fletcher giggs rooney scholes phil neville subs not used howard bellion booked rooney scholes keane goals rooney dunne og att ref s bennett kent

newcastle bolton kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end bolton s game unbeaten run lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended a fluid passing move with a well struck volley but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearer s shot was blocked and firing into the top corner neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first half keeping out shearer s low shot and dyer s close range header but that was the only goalmouth action of note and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on minutes bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half way line and striding forward picked out carr to his right he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carr s cross with a downward header into the far corner bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos jay jay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with a first time strike the magpies were opened up again before half time as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post but the home side survived and they should have re taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant free kick laurent robert curled the ball just wide bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies their strategy seemed to be working until the th minute alan shearer s snap shot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards bolton boss sam allardyce i am bitterly disappointed with the result but i am probably more disappointed with the second half performance in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked newcastle boss graeme souness we deserved the win we had a really good second half bolton are a difficult side to play you have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football we had a slow first minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that the scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals newcastle given carr boumsong bramble babayaro dyer faye bowyer robert jenas ameobi shearer subs not used butt harper milner hughes goals bowyer dyer bolton jaaskelainen hunt fadiga n gotty ben haim candela giannakopoulos okocha vaz te hierro campo speed gardner davies subs not used jaidi poole booked ben haim hierro goals giannakopoulos att ref s dunn gloucestershire

time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the minutes at the end i would say it s whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter finals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole team s worth the debate will rage on and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you england s game against holland is a good example it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember sven goran eriksson s side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed

bees handed potential man utd tie brentford face a home tie against holders manchester united in the fa cup sixth round if they can come through their replay against southampton the league one side held the saints at st mary s in their fifth round tie and were rewarded with a potential draw against sir alex ferguson s side newcastle will be at home to either tottenham or nottingham forest bolton host arsenal or sheffield united and leicester will visit the winners of the burnley and blackburn replay the ties will be played on the weekend of march was delighted to be paired with united although he admitted they still have plenty of work to do to set up a dream tie we ve got our work cut out next tuesday but you ca n t deny it s exciting he said it would be a sell out it will probably be on television we have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation we re happy to be in the draw but we ve still got to beat a premiership team we ve got to beat southampton first and that s going to be a hard game but if we do there will be some celebration welcomed the opportunity to face united we re not counting on anything yet he said it is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way brentford came back at us on saturday and the fact that united have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive but i ve been drawn against united so many times in cups and beaten them at both bournemouth and west ham there are no easy ties in the fa cup and i m sure nobody is counting on one newcastle v tottenham or nottingham forest southampton or brentford v manchester united bolton v arsenal or sheffield united burnley or blackburn v leicester

hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory hodgson now in charge at viking stavanger was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe although not in england where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last of the champions league i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge i am a fervent supporter of the break it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages explaining as i said it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction in pre season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot find themselves getting very jaded the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and perhaps more importantly recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead the mental side is by far the most important thing hodgson added the length of breaks can vary in italy the break was very short you just took christmas and new year it was so short you did n t do anything you gave the players a week or days off then you were training for a week or days and then went into a game if it is longer it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership he said if we talk about football at elite level which the premiership is then i would support a winter break if you examine the demands of the premier league and in particular on players who play international football for their club and country then a break would do them the world of good physically and mentally

arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen s role at the club it is absolutely not true arnesen told bbc radio five live there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just games in charge he added jacques has never gone into exactly what it was but i trust him in that you have to accept it i think we should respect it the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement coming less than hours before tottenham s premiership fixture with charlton when it comes down to personal problems i do n t think we should talk about timing he said and he also denied reports that santini had been given a m pay off that is absolute nonsense he is the one who said i will go and so he went said the spurs sporting director tottenham s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it i have confidence in this structure i am confident that we have started something here in july and i still have a lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing he said however former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift i think the problems go a lot deeper between the director of football at white hart lane and santini stevens told five live on paper they could have worked together but frank arnesen was a very creative forward thinking and expansive player whereas i think santini was very much the opposite more a case of being organised disciplined and happy not conceding goals that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely but it seems that has not happened

tevez an argentine in brazil some years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige which he failed to live up to he left an impression but not for reasons he would have wanted the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play even today gandula is the term used in brazil for ballboy brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then and many will delight now if history is repeated another boca juniors player is coming to brazil the new maradona carlos tevez is joining corinthians for nearly m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year corinthians or the london based company who have just entered into partnership with them appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez it is particularly strange as until last week tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil where the argentine championship is not shown presumably there is some financial logic behind the move what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north rather than across the atlantic argentina s brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez boca re signed martin palermo forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be disorganized hounded by the press tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of tranquillity anyone acquainted with the city of s o paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration brazil s biggest city is a sprawling ugly restless metropolis once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians it is the most passionately supported club in brazil pel scored reams of goals against them reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own that passion can also be turned against the team especially nowadays when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players tevez then can kiss tranquillity goodbye he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores south america s champions league corinthians have not qualified indeed he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match next year s brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april until then he will have to make do with the foolish s o paulo state championship an appalling waste of his talent there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina like so many of the top south american players tevez has the gift of being able to surprise to feint right and go left to pass when he was expected to dribble to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all

can smith work scottish wonders the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager from the moment berti vogts miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football the year old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums scotland have not reached a major finals since the world cup in and reaching germany looks near impossible having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of th below the likes of estonia ghana angola and thailand scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources smith s track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game the man who was alex ferguson s assistant when scotland played at the world cup won seven league titles with rangers and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games top names including ferguson and graeme souness who took him to ibrox as his assistant in characters like souness ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith s experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game much was made of vogts inability to express himself to the players and media that will certainly not be the case with smith the former dundee united and dumbarton full back is from the managerial old school straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better often with the use of some colourful invective but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae a world cup winner as a player and a european championships winner as a manager smith will inherit the same problems vogts had a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call offs that blighted so much of vogts preparation work a fresh start for the scottish national team was imperative and smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands but will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required

kerr frustrated at victory margin republic of ireland manager brian kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over croatia robbie keane took his republic record to with a first half goal which proved enough for victory we had more good chances it is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team said kerr but given the conditions and the standard of the croatian team we should be very happy with the win the republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in matches and are unbeaten in home games since kerr succeeded mick mccarthy kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory it was a brilliant goal fantastic skill by damien duff robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal matchwinner keane was another full of praise for duff s role in the goal it was great play from damien said the tottenham striker i always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of duffer is going to get it in the box playing three up was something different brian kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young stephen elliott getting a run out the conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future it is nice to see young players coming through man of the match duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it midway through the second half he opted to bring steve finnan s cross down and shoot against the bar when a close range header looked the best option i would have headed that every time but i completely lost it in the lights said the chelsea star i was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing we have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers hopefully that can continue in
mourinho plots impressive course chelsea s win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won at fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form as i said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is a priceless commodity no one can be anything other than highly impressed by mourinho he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho does n t simply talk a good game he s won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions i ve also found him to be very realistic whenever i ve heard him he s spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital i also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea s squad i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind if anything what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal s rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining five four is a hockey score not a football score in a three against three training match if the score reaches i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get a result like that in a game of against is disgraceful on a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal s defence confidence is a crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season

curbishley delight for johansson charlton manager alan curbishley paid tribute to two goal striker jonatan johansson after beating norwich curbishley said after the win there was talk about norwich being interested in the summer but i have a lot of faith in jonatan when there was talk of other clubs i just told him he was going nowhere he s part of our squad and he got us a couple of important goals early on i m sure he s happy here but i was delighted with all the players curbishley was subjected to criticism from charlton fans recently and he said the thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction that s happened for however long i ve been here and we do n t want people taking sides
lennon brands rangers favourites celtic s neil lennon admits rangers could be considered slight favourites for the old firm cis cup clash but insists his side can still win lennon concedes rangers are in good form at the moment but they have failed to beat celtic in their last seven meetings rangers are on the up and have been on a good run in recent weeks he said but it s a game we believe we re capable of winning if we play our best he told the evening times all the boys are looking forward to it because they are brilliant games to be involved in without playing at the top of our game we have still been winning matches at the minute we are at the top of the league and still in with a chance of staying in europe so i do n t think it is the crisis people have been trying to make out of course it is a concern when you are losing goals because we have been notorious for being a team that is hard to beat and keeping clean sheets but hopefully we are over that wee run considering we lost henrik larsson at the end of last season we have still been scoring a lot of goals which is pleasing
mcclaren hails boro s uefa spirit middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with european football after the uefa cup win against lazio boro who are playing in europe for the first time in their year history are top of group e with maximum points i think we have taken to europe really well said mcclaren we got about lazio did n t let them settle or play and in possession we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward before the match mcclaren had said that a win over the italian giants would put boro firmly on the european footballing map and after they did just that he said it was a perfect european night for the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake there have been many good performances but this was something special you can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing to win in europe you need to defend well and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games we can also score goals and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had so we have good balance mcclaren s only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals it should have been more convincing said mcclaren but i had watched lazio in recent weeks and i saw them score a late equaliser against inter milan on saturday so i knew we needed a second goal no matter what anybody says lazio are favourites to win this competition middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals we did n t expect it to be that one sided said zenden we did quite well in the first half we pressured them and they did n t cope with that i think we played quite well and it was a very good game especially in the first half the holland international said boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games we ve got a very good feeling there is a good spirit all the lads work hard for each other and it s a squad of friendly players which i think you can see on the pitch he added
benitez delight after crucial win liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group jorge andrade s early own goal gave liverpool a win and benitez said we started at a very high tempo and had many chances it is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack we are pleased but move on to the next game igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso and benitez said he played very well it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level benitez added it is all back in our own hands now it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen as far as my feelings about winning in spain that is really not important i want to see us win away matches in the champions league that it was in spain was not my first consideration as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in benitez added benitez said we had a problem before the start it was decided that xabi could not play more than minutes but in the end because of the way that dietmar hamann and igor biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed but we knew that if we hit them on the counter attack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out deportivo coach javier irureta said liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down i know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination the goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it i know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that

mourinho to escape fa charge chelsea boss jose mourinho will not face any football association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half time but an fa spokesman told bbc sport we are not taking action over mourinho we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required that is the end of it mourinho was concerned that ferguson s conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official i see one referee in the first half and another in the second said mourinho if the fa ask me what happened i will tell them what i saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things maybe when i turn and have been managing in the same league for years and have the respect of everybody i will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free kicks it was fault after fault dive after dive but i know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half time he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him but there was also someone else referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity i m hoping he might reconsider his comments unfortunately this is the nature of the game said hackett i do n t want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers for the second leg we have an experienced referee and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing sometimes managers have grounds for comments and i note that but a referees integrity has been questioned that is offensive and should be avoided mr mourinho should look at the facts mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final it s so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time he said we have exactly the same chance we had before this game we are confident of getting a result but we know what manchester united is a footballing power it ll be difficult for us but also for them

wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute the pair s long running row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was a disgrace wenger initially refused to bite back saying only i will never answer any questions any more about this man but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association the latest twist in the ferguson wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss in an interview with the independent newspaper discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october united won that day at old trafford but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw ferguson s clothes covered in soup and pizza the sides meet again at highbury on february in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players calling them cheats so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself ferguson said on saturday he ran at me with hands raised saying what do you want to do about it to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable it s a disgrace but i do n t expect wenger to ever apologise he s that type of person those allegations were put to wenger after saturday s game at bolton which arsenal lost to slip points behind chelsea in the title race at first he said only i ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened if he has to talk he talks if he wants to make a newspaper article he makes a newspaper article he does n t interest me and does n t matter to me at all i will never answer to any provocation from him any more he does what he likes in england anyway he can go abroad one day and see how it is but later on saturday according to the independent wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction i have no diplomatic relations with him the arsenal boss is quoted as saying what i do n t understand is that he does what he wants and you the press are all at his feet the situation concerning the food fight has been judged and there is a game going on in a month the managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game now the whole story starts again i do n t go into that game we play football i am a football manager and i love football above all no matter what people say reminded that ferguson called him a disgrace wenger added i do n t respond to anything in england you have a good phrase it is bringing the game into disrepute but that is not only after a game it is as well before a game ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vice chairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public but ferguson added in the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense gill phoned dein three times to complain but nothing was done the return is on february and they will come out with another diatribe david gill and i feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here meanwhile the league managers association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on going row during that stormy game in october united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenal s ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle wenger later accused van nistelrooy of cheating and was fined and severely reprimanded by the football association ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy s tackle which earned the dutchman a ban could have given cole a serious injury but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit he added they are the worst losers of all time they do n t know how to lose maybe it is just manchester united they do n t lose many games to other teams we tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was arsenal s up until last season in fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue but to wenger it never happens it is all some dream or nightmare

wenger shock at newcastle dip arsenal manager arsene wenger has admitted he is at a loss to explain why newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table the gunners travel to st james park on wednesday with newcastle th in the premiership after a troubled season and wenger said at the beginning of the season you would expect them to be fighting for the top four i do n t know how they got to be where they are it looks to me from the outside that they have many injuries arsenal go into the game on the back of a victory over fulham on sunday and wenger added the best way to prepare for a game is to win the previous one we will go to newcastle in good shape fatigue wo n t play too big a part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so i can rotate a bit more we do not play a season with players and i believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team striker thierry henry along with robert pires scored against fulham and henry afterwards described the display as beautiful to watch he said what matters is winning and the three points of course that is the only thing that really matters but it is more enjoyable when you play like we did against fulham we are playing as a team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as a team and suffered for that those were games we lost
ferguson hails man utd s resolve manchester united s alex ferguson has praised his players gutsy performance in the win at aston villa that was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football end to end with lots of good passing said the old trafford boss we showed lots of character and guts and we were n t going to lose i look at that fixture and think we ve been there and won while arsenal and chelsea have yet to come and villa may have some players back when they do ferguson also hailed senior stars ryan giggs and roy keane who came off the bench for the injured john o shea roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration all we can do is maintain our form play as we are and we ll get our rewards
tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not given the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why ca n t we just stop the game and get the decision right said jol after the draw but at the end of the day it s so obvious that pedro s shot was over the line it s incredible we feel robbed but it s difficult for the linesman and referee to see it mendes shot from yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear jol added we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was a metre inside the goal what really annoys me is that we are here in watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee is n t told about it we did n t play particularly well but i am pleased even now with a point although we should have had three mendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing a replay he said my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate it was a very nice goal it was clearly over the line i ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career it s really really over what can you do but laugh about it it s a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it did n t count it s not every game you score from the halfway line manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that s that technology should play a part in the game ferguson told mutv what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee ca n t make up his mind after seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free kick or take a corner or a goal kick so you would n t be wasting a lot of time i think you could start off by using it for goal line decisions i think that would be an opening into a new area of football arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford that just reinforces what i feel there should be video evidence said wenger it s a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal
hodgson shoulders england blame fly half charlie hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in england s defeat to france hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given england a late win i m very disappointed with the result and with my myself hodgson said it is very hard to take but it s something i will have to get through and come back stronger my training s been good but it just did n t happen hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were out of my range but the centre could not convert his opportunities either particularly the drop goal late on it was n t a good strike he added i felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed it s very disappointing but i must recover andy robinson said he would keep working on the kicking with his squad however the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done he said they won the game from kicking penalties from our m line it s very frustrating the lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half they went out to sustain it in the second but could n t build on it we took the ball into contact and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side we have lost a game we should have won there is a fine line between winning and losing and for the second week we ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts england went in at half time with a lead but they failed to score in the second half and dimitri yachvili slotted over four penalties as france overhauled the deficit england skipper jason robinson admitted his side failed to cope with france s improved second half display we controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half time he said we made a lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us they took their chances when they came it s very disappointing last week we lost by two points now one point

robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the loss as he contemplates sunday s set to with france at twickenham lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour the bath fly half cum centre is likely to start against france with either tait or noon dropping out tait given little opportunity to shine in attack received praise from robinson afterwards even if the coach admitted cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line after just one outing a player he regards as central to england s future tait himself at least outwardly appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular i want more of that definitely he said hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see we were playing on our own for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france his newcastle team mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build up to wales try conceded a penalty at the breakdown was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross kick into touch all inside the first quarter his contribution improved in the second half but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role up front the line out remains fallible despite a superb performance from chris jones whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards with andy hazell likely to make way lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all round display on his return to the side but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground

jones happy with henson heroics wales fly half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match winning kick against england jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales down were awarded a long range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff i knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me jones said when he said he wanted it there were no problems jones had seen a long range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour before charlie hodgson put england in front with minutes left i looked at where it was and i knew i was going to struggle to make it jones added i said to gareth thomas the wales captain this is touch and go it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance he was confident and fancied it there were no questions that he d miss it the way he was playing he had a superb game jones was happy to hail henson s heroic contribution to wales first win over england in cardiff since physically he s a specimen he s a balanced player he glides when he runs and obviously he s got a great kicking game as well jones said his defence was superb he made some great hits and he had a great game i m glad he s welsh victory over england for the first time since will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year s six nations but they now face three away fixtures in italy france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby said a proud coach mike ruddock but we are not there yet the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins we have to travel this week and we ca n t afford to get too giddy about this result we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy none more so than henson who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian o driscoll the confident year old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however i m the sort of player who likes pressure on me he said it makes me more concentrated and i think i perform better under more pressure i set a high standard against england and i ve got to back it up next week two years ago when we played italy i was n t involved and we lost so we ve got to put that right next week

kirwan demands italy consistency italy coach john kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing ireland close when they meet wales on saturday despite losing in sunday s six nations encounter the italians confirmed their continuing improvement our goal is to match every side we face and against ireland we showed we could do that said kirwan but the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play wales on saturday italy s half backs had a mixed afternoon with recalled scrum half alessandro troncon impressing but fly half luciano orquera having an off day with the boot kirwan said i was very happy with troncon he had an incredible game he was very good in attack and defence orquera s kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence he also followed the game plan we have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well

wales critical of clumsy grewcock wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of wales win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot leaving peel bloodied grewcock was sin binned with wales captain gareth thomas for retaliation it s up to the citing commissioner said ruddock i m not saying it s deliberate but grewcock did a similar thing for bath against leinster last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against new zealand six years earlier also in new zealand grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental if the ball is at the back of the ruck and i feel i can step over and disrupt it then i will do that said grewcock but ruddock feels that the england man should be more careful the boy himself should look at his actions it was a clumsy piece of footwork he said he s a great player and i do n t want to knock him we wo n t be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident i m not going to go too far with the lad it could just be a clumsy action and dwayne had just a minor cut the referee s interpretation was that grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck ruddock also warned his rbs nations championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements we created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually said the coach we ve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted in the forthcoming games ruddock may use penalty hero gavin henson as his first choice kicker in place of stephen jones our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team but it s something we ll talk about in selection this week said ruddock
henson stakes early lions claim the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson he s very confident you just had to listen to his interview afterwards he beamed with confidence but although there s an element of arrogance it s good arrogance he certainly showed some nice touches he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand and that s without even mentioning his majestic match winning penalty but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test he needs to come up against brian o driscoll or a big french midfield wales fly half stephen jones was another player who impressed me he gave good direction he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side he showed he can control a game with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number shirt could be up for grabs and jones or maybe even henson could make the lions team at fly half jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday s game some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out muscled in the tight five england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top however i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame some english players did their cause no harm i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france tom smith has been there and done it before but the likes of chris cusiter jason white and ally hogg all made their mark hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game his defence is right up there cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward the star of ireland s win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand brian o driscoll is a class act he ran some good lines against italy made the breaks and fed his outside backs although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him gordon d arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson d arcy o driscoll combination in the lions midfield paul o connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm o kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up while shane byrne seems to be a lively character but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be one player who did n t impress me was wales scrum half dwayne peel he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing they had good possession and he kicked the ball away i would n t want him as my lions scrum half after that
murphy that was a bruising battle that s what i call a tough game it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it i m not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half it s always good to score it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee eddie o sullivan was very calm at half time even though we were only ahead he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half we were penalised a lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover it s a big ask after such a bruising encounter i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us in the meantime when in rome
wales make two changes for france wales coach mike ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat italy for saturday s trip to france kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing and in the pack neath swansea ospreys forward ryan jones is preferred at blindside flanker to jonathan thomas thomas a try scorer in rome drops down to the bench instead of ian gough while cardiff back rhys williams steps up in place of morgan luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the six nations game against italy last weekend however the experienced and in form morgan was already pushing hard for a start at stade de france due to his impressive performances from the bench kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway and the unfortunate injury to hal gives him the chance to start said ruddock now that ryan jones has recovered from injury we have increased the options in the back row jonathan thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against italy and scoring a try but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail for this particular game we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against italy so an extra big ball carrier in the back row is thought to be necessary on this occasion obviously it s a man game these days and there is every chance that jonathan will be making an impact from the bench wales have beaten france on two of their last three visits to paris and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first five or six nations title triumph since graham henry former wales coach said a couple of years ago that we should be bold when going to france and he was proved right said ruddock that is a great way to approach the game and something we will further endorse with the players this week g thomas toulouse capt k morgan newport gwent t shanklin cardiff g henson neath swansea s williams neath swansea s jones clermont auvergne d peel llanelli g jenkins cardiff m davies gloucester a jones neath swansea b cockbain neath swansea r sidoli cardiff r jones neath swansea m williams cardiff m owen newport gwent replacements r mcbryde llanelli j yapp cardiff j thomas neath swansea r sowden taylor cardiff g cooper newport gwent c sweeney newport gwent r williams cardiff

wales win in rome wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six try victory in rome tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a half time advantage luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second half efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory fly half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year s tournament starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owen s long cut out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run in stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson s heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the th minute henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner with the welsh line out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home side s forward power brought them back into it but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch wales regained control with a second try in the st minute henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his th test try jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy henson was also narrowly short with a long range effort at goal but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off loaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half time built up a head of steam on the resumption de marigny landed a penalty to make it and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock on but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour their fourth after minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain before italy could recover from that blow a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over with jones converting both for a lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe but after back to back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in years they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders r de marigny mirco bergamasco w pozzebon a masi l nitoglia l orquera a troncon a lo cicero f ongaro m castrogiovanni s dellape m bortolami capt a persico mauro bergamasco s parisse g intoppa s perugini ca del fava d dal maso p griffen m barbini kp robertson g thomas capt h luscombe t shanklin g henson s williams s jones d peel g jenkins m davies a jones b cockbain r sidoli j thomas m williams m owen r mcbryde j yapp i gough r sowden taylor g cooper c sweeney k morgan andrew cole australia
white prepared for battle tough scrummaging prop julian white is expecting a resurgent wales to give him a rough ride in england s six nations opener in cardiff on saturday the leicester tight head is in the form of his life making the england number three shirt his own but he knows wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny the welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with he told bbc sport they have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years white is also impressed with the welsh pack s strength in depth gethin jenkins is starting at loose head for them he has played a bit at tight head but i think his favoured position is loose head and he is very good he added the year old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight head prop in the world he destroyed south africa s os du randt in the scrum at twickenham last autumn to give england the platform for an impressive victory leicester who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of have also been aided by white s presence this season the tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the heineken cup i am pleased with my form he said but my form is helped by the people i play with at leicester people like martin johnson and graham rowntree it s been a good season so far and to be in the starting xv for the first game of the six nations is what every player wants i am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend white is now one of the more experienced members of the england squad which takes to the field on saturday injuries have taken their toll and coach andy robinson has been deprived of richard hill jonny wilkinson martin corry mike tindall will greenwood and stuart abbott and with caps and a world cup winner s medal to his name white is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres matthew tait and jamie noon i do n t know how much experience a tight head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way he added when i first came into the squad people like jason leonard and martin johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out it gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you i was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good white missed the vast majority of last year s six nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the event to get going and that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red hot atmosphere in cardiff i enjoy the atmosphere the millennium stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world he said to go down there and hear the shouting and the singing it s one of my favourite places to play this is probably the most even six nations for a long time england ireland france and wales are all contenders on form ireland should be favourites but you just do n t know that s the great thing about this tournament

wales stars need a rest ruddock wales coach mike ruddock has defended his decision not to release any of the international stars for this weekend s regional celtic league fixtures ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress we ve got the wru charter in place now which outlines exactly what happens ruddock told bbc wales sport once we re in the six nations the players will only be released in his and the wru s best interests the ospreys and scarlets say they are happy to support the wales cause but the dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in friday s game with ulster ceri sweeney gareth cooper ian gough and kevin morgan have been used sparingly by ruddock in the opening two six nations wins and captain jason forster believes they would benefit from a game with the dragons i m sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time forster told bbc wales sport it would also be a timely reminder to mike ruddock as to what they can do and the supporters want to see the star players no disrespect to the other guys performing on the pitch ruddock though is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue at this stage there s nothing more the players can do in games to impress me further we ve got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region for example the dragons might use james ireland this weekend i ve been looking at the lad he s a great prospect for the future french and english clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means stephen jones gareth thomas and mefin davies will play this weekend the majority of ireland and scotland players have also been released for provincial duty

robinson answers critics england captain jason robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are a team in decline england were beaten by wales in their six nations opener in cardiff last week and face current champions france at twickenham on sunday robinson said we are certainly not on the decline you lose one game and it does n t make you a bad team i have no doubt in the players we ve got we have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day england find themselves striving to avoid a third successive championship defeat for the first time since but full back robinson believes the new look england team can stop the rot against france last weekend we should have won the game he said but if we can under perform and lose by only two points then i am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need we proved that in the autumn when we put in some excellent performances and we just need to build on that it was a disappointing start against wales and we might be down on that but we are certainly not out we will come out fighting this week robinson also had words of comfort for year old newcastle centre mathew tait who made his international debut against wales but has been demoted from the squad to face france i have had a word with mathew said robinson i still believe in him he is an outstanding player but we have gone for olly barkley because of the kicking mathew has just got to take it on the chin keep working hard like he is doing and i m sure he will feature in some of the games
sella wants michalak recall former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date but he told bbc sport michalak is the answer both now and for the future delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak he does have weaknesses but has the all round game to upset ireland the year old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season with michalak overlooked the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales the wales game was amazing to watch but never did i think the french could lose that game at half time said sella their only mistakes were that they did n t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second but only a little bit sella however insisted the pressure had eased on the under fire laporte despite the defeat at the stade de france this season is very important for shaping a team for the world cup said sella which laporte is doing very well the french get better every game it s difficult though when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel but he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to world cup victory as a result it is important that people give him time it may not seem good now that we re not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we re world champions the majority of media criticism centred on the way in which france produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales he said the win was most important winning is all that matters he added ok the flair may not have been so good but the discipline organisation and defence was there which are all important ahead of france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday march the french go into the game as clear underdogs but sella added people forget that france can still win the six nations and they ll be focused on that but ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd it s going to be tough

bortolami predicts dour contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday s six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter with both sides looking for their first win of the championship the third round game at murrayfield has been billed as a wooden spoon decider and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win said the lock forward italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in but two of those have come against scotland this year italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing however they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh said bortolami we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs as a nation our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games
corry backs skipper robinson england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways after losses to wales and france critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full back but corry has backed robinson who was given the role after the injury to fly half jonny wilkinson ahead of this weekend s trip to ireland jason is doing a tremendous job every week my respect for him goes up corry told bbc radio five live he is an inspirational captain when he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense the players have a lot of respect for him it s an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest there is apprehension going into every game he added but you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset when the whistle goes on sunday what has happened in the past does not count for anything we have not performed but if we put in a performance on sunday then we can start turning results around there are a lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good a trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard they are full of confidence and are playing a great team game he said the forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide if you look at the team on paper they have stars from one to it s a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us lansdowne road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage

castaignede fires laporte warning former france fly half thomas castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach bernard laporte following their defeat by wales france suffered a shock loss against the welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win castaignede told bbc sport the pressure is big on laporte after a huge loss to new zealand a slim win over scotland and a miracle against england but the french have to get behind him and the team at lansdowne road following victories over south africa and australia in november france were deemed by many to be the world s leading side but they were then trounced by new zealand and only just beat scotland after the scots had a try disallowed in their six nations opener it then took some woeful spot kicking from charlie hodgson and olly barkley to help them to victory against england at twickenham lt castaignede said you ca n t say any of those results have eased the pressure on laporte had england s kickers not been so bad the position in the six nations would be very different now laporte has been criticised for france s negative tactics in their wins over scotland and england but his side played a more free flowing style against wales making a mockery of the opposition s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval all the chat in france has been about how france will play against ireland said castaignede ahead of the march tie everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against wales but everyone also wants a win castaignede a veteran of international caps admitted the french would go in as underdogs against ireland going to ireland is never easy but the way they re playing right now it s harder than ever said castaignede they re very experienced and do n t often lose at home they ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break despite praising the irish he claimed the welsh had the upper hand in the six nations run in ireland have such a good pack but wales are something else on the break he added at the weekend they were simply awesome as a frenchman it was disappointing to see but you had to admire it their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship the year old also tipped yann delaigue to start ahead of frederic michalak at number after an impressive display in paris last weekend delaigue played really well and admittedly michalak played well too said castaignede i m just glad i m not the one who has to make the decision

england coach faces rap after row england coach andy robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee jonathan kaplan in his side s six nations defeat to ireland the rugby football union rfu will investigate robinson after deciding not to lodge a complaint against kaplan robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the international rugby board robinson had said he was livid about kaplan s decisions on saturday to disallow two england tries the england coach went on to claim that only one side was refereed after reviewing tapes of the match the rfu decided not to formally complain to the irb over the standard of kaplan s refereeing instead the rfu said in a statement they would set out any concerns the england team management may have in a confidential manner an irb spokesman said on the matter we take all breaches of the code very seriously should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made it would be the end of the matter kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in england s defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was very disappointed with robinson s remarks and the south african has been appointed to take charge of scotland s match against wales on march the rfu recently fined northampton coach budge pountney and imposed a six week ban for his criticism of referee steve lander after a premiership match
wilkinson return unlikely jonny wilkinson looks set to miss the whole of the rbs six nations england s world cup winning fly half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship but rob andrew coach of wilkinson s club side newcastle said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time it would be irresponsible to put him straight into a test match andrew told the times wilkinson is recovering from a knee injury which followed long term neck and arm injuries he has not played for england since the world cup final in november since when the stuttering world champions have lost nine of their matches wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the zurich premiership match against harlequins on march that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland we are hoping jonny will be ready in a fortnight but it is touch and go said andrew his recovery is going very well and the key now is how he is reintroduced to playing and with it goal kicking he will probably have to come off the bench to start and it would be ridiculous and irresponsible to put him straight back into a test match we ca n t afford to get it wrong with a knee injury we are in touch with england and they are relaxed about it despite not playing for england wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer lions coach sir clive woodward has not set a deadline for when wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection
england to launch ref protest england will protest to the international rugby board irb about the referee s performance in the defeat by ireland reports the daily mail england coach andy robinson has called on ex international referees colin high and steve lander to analyse several of jonathan kaplan s decisions i want to go through the tape with colin and steve robinson told the daily mail i want to speak to the irb about it i think only one side was refereed high the rugby football union s referees manager claimed kaplan made three major errors which changed the outcome of sunday s match england were beaten by the irish in dublin their third straight defeat in the six nations the international rugby board will be disappointed high told the daily mail jonathan kaplan is in the top in the world but that was n t an international performance it would not have been acceptable in the zurich premiership if one of my referees had done that i would have had my backside kicked for making the appointment if any english referee refereed like that in a european match there would be an inquest no question about that if someone had performed like that he would have been pulled from the next game
moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full back jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament in the absence of fly half jonny wilkinson the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson a lock forward and former england captain moore told the bbc full backs are too far away from the action that s not a reflection on robinson personally he added i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack which is after all where games usually start and finish moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales france and ireland in this year s tournament assertiveness in the pack is n t there we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns he explained wer e not getting quick ball which means the backs are being stifled their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury do n t have the requisite experience moore added you ca n t do anything about that but play them there are players who have been knocking on the door it s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there s nothing on them we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby
owen set for skipper role wales number eight michael owen says replacing gareth thomas as wales captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad you dream about playing for wales but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country he said it s an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side but it will be a massive honour coach mike ruddock says the year old should take the armband from broken thumb victim thomas against scotland ruddock praised owen s contribution as vice captain and pack leader in this year s wins over england italy and france notably his role in the second half in paris following thomas injury the cap dragons man says that thomas will be badly missed though gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain said owen he has put his own unique stamp on things we are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like kevin morgan to step in owen admitted the grand slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no one was getting carried away with the three victories over england italy and france we ca n t get ahead of ourselves he said we have a massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that scotland are improving all the time like us they did well in france and were unlucky not to get a win against ireland they played fantastically well in the first minutes before falling away they are probably going on a similar journey to the one we have been on in the last couple of years

o sullivan keeps his powder dry when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential ireland coach eddie o sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run up to this season s six nations championship he decreed after the world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year that became a reality at the end of last summer with a week period at the start of the this season it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday but like o sullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it the irfu has thrown their weight behind o sullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrally controlled contracts bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg everyone of o sullivan s squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season s campaign but i doubt whether o sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players he is not that sort of person however he may look at the overworked and injury hit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season a first grand slam since karl mullen s led the team to a clean sweep in with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled take the triple crown winning side of under mick doyle they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam only the second in ireland s history what happened in whitewashed you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary it is the nature of the beast but o sullivan s side are very capable of proving a salient point this season after their first triple crown for years they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder o sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades and there is more to come he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this season s championship with a different box of tricks and a new verve to succeed ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it

funding cut hits wales students the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby union s reorganisation at youth level an amalgamated under side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday against italy at the gnoll but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students as a result traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union reverend eldon phillips said it is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge that is representative rugby but this year that opportunity will be denied them players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones rob howley jon humphreys darren morris martyn williams and ceri sweeney
calder fears for scottish rugby former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his country s rbs six nations campaign four members of the executive board including the chairman david mackay have resigned after a simmering row and calder said this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby david is a successful businessman and i thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level it was him mackay s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee which contains members elected by scotland s club sides he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby ca n t be run by amateurs said calder in fact i do n t understand why we are still having this argument years after professionalism arrived but i do n t believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down i think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and ultimately it is them who pull the strings so i would n t be surprised if they reviewed their position but in the wider picture what message does this send out he thought the work of scotland s coaches who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side would be made much more difficult matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering what have we walked into here said calder and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship i am very very disappointed more than you can imagine why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough
a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most well at least there used to one now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction and sorrow it has been quite a year for the irish and not just with eddie o sullivan s triple crown winning international outfit either right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game but most of the kudos will go to o sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for years but also finished their autumn campaign with a record for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners up spot in the rbs six nations but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa ireland finsihed the year on a high the victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer those two reverses and the flop against france were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent months but the big one of course was the defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf the winning try was conceived in o sullivan s mind perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey for me the try of the championship o sullivan s career is now in vertical take off mode it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway based coach to head the lions test side not only that but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand there can be no doubt that ireland s representation will be the biggest ever albeit in a proposed man squad in brian o driscoll and paul o connell ireland have now the two front runners for the captaincy gordon d arcy whose career began as a teenager back in finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well the under squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners up to england in the six nations under tournament on the provincial front leinster for second year in succession blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager while ulster finished runners up in their very tight group for the second season in succession it was munster again flying the flag for the irish looking to reach their third final they went down to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road how wasps recovered from that energy sapping duel and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody s guess ulster meanwhile just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game ulster however took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first outings in the celtic league leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing on the down side irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under world cup game in durban that happened only days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools cup success since the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in the last time that goal had been achieved before this season ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well known londonderry ym player jim huey coleraine s jonathan hutchinson and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole they all passed away long before the full time whistle
williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby the chairman chief executive and three non executive directors all departed in a row over the game s future direction but williams said i want to make it clear that i m committed totally to scottish rugby i ve brought my family here and we ve immersed ourselves in scottish life there s no way that i m walking away however he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute i d like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation he said when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you who are jealous and want to try to drag you down when you have that situation you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case like all good coaches you go and ask for an increase but we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that the idea that we are lighting cigars with notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team but let me give you the truth our irish counterparts whom we have to compete with in a few days time had days together at the summer they are currently in camp now and they will have another days in camp before the six nations that means they will have days away from their club from july until the six nations we on the other hand will have there must be a win win philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after both groups winning not competing
lomu relishing return to action former all black star jonah lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former england rugby union captain martin johnson s testimonial on june the year old had a kidney transplant in july but will play his first full match for three years leading a southern hemisphere side at twickenham i actually started training three weeks after my operation but i was very limited until a few months ago now it s basically bring it on said the giant winger the match on june will be my first man game but i have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things said lomu i have got so much energy since my operation that i train three times a day six days a week mohammed ali has always been my ideal coming back to rugby people said you are dreaming but it always starts off with a dream it s up to you whether you want to make it a reality opinion has been divided on whether lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation but when lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied as much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus there are a lot of people in the world with one kidney who just do n t know it i have talked this over had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something i started in when he made his all blacks debut at his lowest ebb lomu was so ill he could barely walk but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long term target is to play for new zealand again the only person who saw me at my worst was my wife he added i used to take two steps and fall over but now i can run and it is all coming back and a lot more quickly than i ever thought it would to play for the all blacks would be the highest honour i could get that is the long term goal and you have to start somewhere

a november to remember last saturday one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion with australia s triumph in london followed by france s capitulation to new zealand clearly there is no number one side in the world at the moment declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney there are four five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about while that bodes well for rugby as a whole it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade while the wallabies all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super matters in the new year europe s finest have less than weeks before they return to the international fray and for the first time in more than a decade it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title that owes much to ireland s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays who secured a first triple crown in years last season could go one better and win their first five six nations title since they start with away games against italy and scotland before england and france come to lansdowne road their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland s self belief while ronan o gara s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o sullivan s side can now close out tight games not that england or france who have won nine of the last six nations titles between them will lay down quietly dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio they still have the personnel to prosper the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden but the fresh shoots of post world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff a fourth title in six years is within reach are in familiar revival territory but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style while south africa s over confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set piece platform from his pack there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february the last fortnight has left in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia a stunning defeat to argentina their first loss since the world cup could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency but the manner of new zealand s demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard fortunately for the french the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining in paris after two reasonable performances against australia the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations a lack of top class players will continue to undermine their best efforts who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february

wru proposes season overhaul the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks the season would start with the celtic league in october followed by the heineken cup in february and march and the six nations moved to april and may after a nine week break the wru then proposes a two month period of away and home international matches wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country he added we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation equally we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing pickering argued the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed pickering added it s very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it not least the revenue from the broadcasters which is extremely important we ve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits

dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career even the end of his nine year career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglio s crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back row positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captain s band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team mate martin johnson he played a massive role in the series victory but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglio s career hit the buffers at speed in first came the last minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio s decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson as a member of a new look england side on the long road to world cup glory a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again yet another setback arrived in as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglio s involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of england s world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england s historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnson s retirement dallaglio s career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio s second spell as captain losing five of their eight post world cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england s most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio s role as captain but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the year old although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no stand out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio s massive influence on english rugby

ireland argentina an injury time dropped goal by ronan o gara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday o gara kicked all of ireland s points with two dropped goals and five penalties to give the home side a record in their autumn internationals an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu and felipe contepomi kicked points the well drilled and sharper pumas out played and out thought ireland in the early stages indiscipline allowed argentina s leinster fly half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts o gara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later playing into a strong wind and rain ireland continued to come second best in tight situations and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence o gara managed to land his second penalty in the th minute but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first half injury time the second half started as the first had ended o gara rifled over another penalty in the th minute but contepomi matched it three minutes later the upper body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front while the three quarters had no space to manoeuvre ireland had to rely on o gara s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays the munsterman landed two more penalties one of them from metres to bring his team to within four points with minutes on the clock remaining and ireland s chance came when argentina s number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line out o gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow o gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous if fortuitous comeback

healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday s return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations healey who won caps prior to the world cup has been in good form in the tigers resurgence this season i definitely still have ambitions to play for england healey told the bbc we will have to see what happens after the previous autumn tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me healey who has also played both half back positions and full back during his career has reverted to the wing where he won most of his england caps after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september the year old is relishing his role in the tigers revival i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before he said i am basically playing where it best suits leicester obviously i can play scrum half fly half or full back at a moment s notice but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps leicester trilogy in recent weeks first healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury time try that earned the tigers a draw in their premiership meeting on november then in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday healey slotted in at stand off and delivered a superb cross kick for martin corry to score the tigers third try i caught cozza s eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score healey recalled healey twice a heineken cup winner believes last sunday s match was up there with some of the biggest club contests he has played in it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game he recalled there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in after about minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed rugby s version of rocky ii there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done he added it was the first of a two leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did we have got to show the same desire again this week

paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday s epic in paris and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris welsh legend mervyn davies a member of two of three grand slam winning sides of the s hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades martyn williams wales two try scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games i have ever played in a crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observed there was a french half and there was a welsh half and what a half it was for the red dragonhood transforming a half time deficit into an lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period but while that passage of play showed the swelling self belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side that they recovered from a battering in the first half hour to first stem the tide before half time then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail biting final five minutes wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve in international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline ten of the on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced in paris two years ago but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the world cup wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach mike ruddock the likes of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer s lions tour to new zealand and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve jones after his superb man of the match display observed that we are a very happy camp now ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad the joie de vivre so evident in that magical second half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the s if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats similarly wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decision making under pressure are equally important so on to murrayfield where wales have not won on their last three visits while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating scotland only then with the visit of ireland to finish can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the s and writing their own names into welsh legend
wales silent on grand slam talk rhys williams says wales are still not thinking of winning the grand slam despite a third six nations win that s the last thing on our minds at the moment said williams a second half replacement in saturday s win over france in paris we all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to scotland and beat them we ve come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we ll worry about ireland hopefully after we ve beaten scotland with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at full back leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth a hamstring injury denied luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start but the dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to murrayfield on march hooker robin mcbryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in paris but centre sonny parker and flanker colin charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection said wales assistant coach scott johnson they ve worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive so we re getting a couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad scotland secured their first win of the campaign on saturday by grinding out an win over italy matt williams side has shown little in attack but johnson insisted the scots will be difficult opposition to break down italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it s very hard to win he said so an ugly win can be just as effective as a or point victory scotland are a hard side and very underrated so we re not taking anything for granted we re not basking in the glory of winning our first three games we ve got to be diligent in our preparation that s my job and we ve got to make sure we re focused
sculthorpe wants lions captaincy paul sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed andy farrell as great britain skipper if the wigan star does switch codes to rugby union sculthorpe was vice captain in the tri nations and took the st helens captaincy from chris joynt last year i would definitely want the job i make no bones about it sculthorpe told bbc sport it s something i ve always wanted to do i d gladly take it if it was offered to me the year old who captained st helens to challenge cup success last year said following in the footsteps of farrell would be a challenge andy would be a hard act to follow but it s something i m confident of being up to he said the gb team is n t a one man team there are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway sculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if farrell did decide to move to rugby union it s a short career and you have to make of it what you can said sculthorpe nobody can blame him if he does go he s done everything in the game of rugby league financially it could set him up for life if he fancies a new challenge then who could fault him sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play sean long sculthorpe s saints and lions team mate has expressed doubts about his international future i think sean s situation is to do with the sheer number of games we re playing he said the way he s looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby then he s willing to do that the rfl has got to do something about the fixtures we re playing weeks of the year and it s too much a lot of the niggly injuries that i ve suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time st helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward sonny bill williams and sculthorpe said he would love the year old to come to knowsley road he s a great player a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence but who is also very skilful he said i d love him to come to st helens who knows what might happen but you want the best players in your team and he s certainly one of the best players in the world
tigers wary of farrell gamble leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester at the moment there are still a lot of unknowns about andy farrell not least his medical situation whoever does take him on is going to take a big big gamble farrell who has had persistent knee problems had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the man game if he does move across to union wells believes he would better off playing in the backs at least initially i m sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre said wells i think england would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide at this club the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready made replacement
farrell saga to drag on lindsay wigan chairman maurice lindsay says he does not expect a quick solution to the on going saga of captain andy farrell s possible switch to rugby union leicester and saracens are leading the chase for the player but lindsay told the bbc it was not yet a done deal as well as the rugby football union the league the individual club and the england coaching team have a say so it s not a quick decision he said he s given us years service so if he wants to go we d support him the prospect of farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the super league season so far it came as a bolt out of the blue to us admitted lindsay but he s a very loyal friend to the club so there s no question that he s deserting us he just fancies a challenge although the move would be a lucrative one for both farrell and wigan lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club the money side of things has n t been concluded but it s not the point for wigan he told radio five live a shortage of money has never been a problem for us even if we did have it under the salary cap we ca n t spend a penny of it anyway we d rather have the player lindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up farrell it d be a great loss for us but a great boost for them said the warriors chief this guy is an absolute sporting icon he s been at the top for so long and has demonstrated so many attributes that you need to make it in a tough contact sport athletes like him ellery hanley and martin johnson do n t come along very often you re very lucky to have them whilst you ve got them

wales hails new superstar one game into his six nations career and gavin henson is already a welsh legend a mesmeric display against england topped off by his howitzer of a match winning penalty has secured life membership of that particular club at henson has the rugby world at his silver booted feet and if his natural self assurance and swagger is shared by his wales team mates then a full blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the valleys the red dragonhood subdued the red rose army in most areas of the field but henson s stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others he announced himself in the game s opening salvo with a welcome to cardiff greeting for mark cueto on the gain line and his defence was a major feature of the match his principal victim poor old or rather young mathew tait the england centre will have spent his th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up ended not just once but twice by henson s all enveloping tackles the second time after the interval single handedly lifted the record millennium stadium crowd at a time when england were starting to show menace showing awesome strength henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid air a master predator toying with his helpless prey savouring the kill his kicking game also prospered particularly when he moved to full back for minutes either side of half time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin bin one huge clearance from tait s kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half henson was also creativity personified one little chip ahead for shane williams narrowly missed its target a precise cross kick forcing jamie noon to fumble the ball into touch he also had a hand in the game s only try finished superbly by williams and might have scored himself on the half hour as he glided into space only to be scragged by tait henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgson s penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time but he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din and the outcome of the match fell to him replacement gareth cooper made the most of a poor welsh scrum by chipping into space where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle five metres in from the right touchline metres out it was not a kick stephen jones who had seen a long range effort fall agonisingly under the bar would have approached with confidence it was out of steve s range but i looked at gavin and he gave me a reassuring nod said thomas henson surveying his date with destiny positively relished the responsibility and the chance to make himself a hero without further ado he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of english dominance and years of waiting in cardiff i knew i was going to get it before i even took the kick he said later his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape i have been getting them from that distance all year so it was n t a problem there were still four minutes for wales to hold out and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away but it was wales who finished the game on the attack almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax just do it implored the front page headline on saturday s western mail newspaper and thanks to henson wales did

celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam play off in three weeks time but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french no one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on march sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham but how the mighty have fallen england sat on rugby s summit months ago as world champions and grand slam winners but they have lost nine of their matches since that heady night in sydney and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon play off against italy in a fortnight england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost a phalanx of world cup stars and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team the same year that england ruled the roost a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations and they won only two games against scotland and italy in wales most recent championship title was in and their last grand slam success came in in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with a broken thumb accurate kicking from either fly half stephen jones or centre gavin henson a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams ireland coach eddie o sullivan and captain brian o driscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearly men tag that has dogged them for the past few years the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners up for the past two years to france and england but they have not won the title since and last clinched a grand slam in as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials and so to france brilliant one minute inept the next but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on march
ireland win eclipses refereeing errors the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly up it may have to go the whole way and have nfl style video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since the game was as exciting as it comes with a much improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way one can understand that frustration there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s blazers referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made after all he has no public recourse to criticism it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cueto s first half effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown but in rugby everything tends to even out over the minutes the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan o gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line those were the stand out moments in a classic game between the two old foes but there were many more and one should not take away from those brian o driscoll s winning try was as well conceived as they come while charlie hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight and ronan o gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final minutes two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on the first was denis hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right hand corner he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross field kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try ireland s second row colossus paul o connell was equally superb england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers unfortunately he ran into o connell who hit him hard very hard and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover that spoke volumes about ireland s back foot display with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships
ireland england ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with a stirring victory at lansdowne road a second half try from captain brian o driscoll and points from ronan o gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since england scored first through martin corry but had tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed andy robinson s men have now lost nine of their last matches since the world cup final the defeat also heralded england s worst run in the championship since ireland last won the title then the five nations in but years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales and eddie o sullivan s side banished the ghosts of when england were rampant victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road in front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in dublin ireland tore into the white shirted visitors from the kick off and made their intentions clear when o gara landed a fourth minute drop goal england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland s half produced a simple score for corry the number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line racing yards to touch down england fly half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left but almost immediately o gara winning his th cap answered with two penalties in quick succession england were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after minutes and hodgson the villain at twickenham coolly bisected the posts the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs a series of probes led by the talismanic o driscoll back from hamstring injury resulted in a penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch from the line out the ball was recycled back to o gara who stroked his second drop goal this time off the right upright as the interval approached wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england s most promising attack the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson s cross kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half but another english indiscretion on a rare irish break out awarded o gara a kick at goal which he missed england s pressure continued and a wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed a drop goal the lead was shortlived however ireland raced upfield deft handling from the backs including a clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson ending with o driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts o gara missed a penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when hodgson s cross kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky high but o gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop goal attempt inside the last minutes england poured forward spurred on by scrum half matt dawson who replaced leicester s harry ellis but despite one near miss with the pack over the line not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan england were unable to pull off a face saving win ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff england are still to meet italy at twickenham in what is now a wooden spoon decider and scotland g murphy g dempsey b o driscoll s horgan d hickie r o gara p stringer r corrigan s byrne j hayes m o kelly p o connell s easterby j o connor a foley f sheahan m horan d o callaghan e miller g easterby d humphreys k maggs j robinson capt m cueto j noon o barkley j lewsey c hodgson h ellis g rowntree s thompson m stevens d grewcock b kay j worsley l moody m corry a titterrell d bell s borthwick a hazell m dawson a goode o smith
fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson said he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sunday s six nations loss to ireland in dublin mark cueto s first half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes i m absolutely spitting i m livid there s two tries we ve been cost robinson told bbc sport we ve got to go back to technology i do n t know why we did n t south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly half hoisted his cross field kick for the sale wing to gather kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game winning try i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey said robinson it is how we use the technology it is there and it should be used i am still trying to work out the cueto try i have looked at both and they both looked tries we are very disappointed and this will hurt there is no doubt about that we are upset now but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that we did everything we could have done to win the game i am very proud of my players and with a couple of decisions this could have been a very famous victory i thought we dominated matt stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop while the likes of charlie hodgson martin corry and lewis moody all came through well josh lewsey was awesome and every one of the forwards stood up out there given the pressure we were under credit must go to all the players we have done everything but win a game of rugby but ireland are a good side they defended magnificently and they ve got every chance of winning this six nations england have lost their first three matches in this year s six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september
scotland italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield coach matt williams side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led at the break paterson slotted four more second half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy chasing their first away win in the six nations scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick lead through the boot of full back paterson but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt missed by full back roland de marigny and a wayward drop goal effort from luciano orquera scotland defended the initial thrusts but on minutes italy after coming up yards short of the line equalised through a de marigny penalty italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left footed de marigny pushed his kick wide scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck as the half wore on both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically if not psychologically on top italy s de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long range kick shaved the right upright and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on minutes williams side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and after a couple of probing attacks paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson another paterson penalty on minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors but john kirwan s men had the last laugh when gordon ross attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try converted by de marigny c paterson s webster a craig h southwell s lamont d parks c cusiter t smith g bulloch capt g kerr s grimes s murray s taylor j petrie a hogg r russell b douglas n hines j dunbar m blair g ross b hinshelwood r de marigny mirco bergamasco c stoica a masi l nitoglia l orquera a troncon a lo cicero f ongaro m castrogiovanni s dellape m bortolami capt a persico d dal maso s parisse g intoppa s perugini ca del fava s orlando p griffen r pedrazzi kp robertson
o connell rejects lions rumours ireland and munster lock paul o connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer o connell is rumoured to be among the front runners for the job but says he is totally focused on sunday s six nations crunch clash with england i honestly do n t think about these reports he told bbc sport the lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk nothing more i just ignore it and get on with my job he added the only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think i can just imagine them saying i m going to show this guy what s what about second row play that s the one thing that makes me cringe o connell who made a try scoring international debut against wales two years ago is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby s shop window but refuses to be drawn on the lions i have spoken to sir clive woodward a few times but not for very long certainly nothing about summer holidays he joked he also said he remains wary of wounded england s abilities coming into sunday s game after two straight defeats dismissing predictions of a certain irish victory it s very dangerous to think that this england team has so much experience and skill you do not become a bad team overnight they have two world class game breakers in josh lewsey and jason robinson while charlie hodgson is just ready to click into place he insisted ireland will not make the mistake of being over confident that s not going to happen in our squad no ireland team lining up to play england will ever fall into that trap he said every time we play england we know what a big task it is look at what they did to us two years ago i remember that game all too well and it was not a good feeling i came on as a replacement and we were losing and ended up getting hammered so i know what can happen when england come to dublin they could so easily have been coming to dublin with two wins and staring a grand slam in the face as well

england france england suffered an eighth defeat in tests as scrum half dimitri yachvili booted france to victory at twickenham two converted tries from olly barkley and josh lewsey helped the world champions to a half time lead but charlie hodgson and barkley missed six penalties between them while yachvili landed six for france to put the visitors in front england could have won the game with three minutes left but hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide it was a dismal defeat for england coming hard on the heels of an opening six nations loss in wales they should have put the game well beyond france s reach but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half a scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against wales and scotland respectively hodgson had an early opportunity to settle english nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide but a probing kick from france centre damien traille saw mark cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle yachvili giving france the lead with a kick from wide out france twice turned over england ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum one ben kay charge apart a spell of tit for tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides until england refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner only to botch the subsequent line out but england made the breakthrough after minutes when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try jamie noon took a short pass from barkley and ran a good angle to plough through yann delaigue s flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts hodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several french infringements on the floor for a lead the fly half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after france full back pepito elhorga scragged by lewsey threw the ball into touch barkley also missed two longer range efforts as the first half drew to a close but by then england had scored a second converted try after a series of phases lock danny grewcock ran hard at the french defence and off loaded out of sylvain marconnet s tackle to lewsey the industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker sebastien bruno to sprint over after a dire opening to the second half france threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation wing jimmy marlu having already departed injured yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after minutes and when lewis moody was twice penalised for handling in a ruck and then straying offside the scrum half s unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points barkley then missed his third long range effort to increase the tension and after seeing another attempt drop just short yachvili put france ahead with his sixth penalty with minutes left england sent on ben cohen and matt dawson and after barkley s kick saw christophe dominici take the ball over his own line the stage was set for a victory platform but even after a poor scrummage hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop goal attempt wide england threw everything at the french in the final frantic moments but the visitors held on for their first win at twickenham since j robinson capt m cueto j noon o barkley j lewsey c hodgson h ellis g rowntree s thompson p vickery d grewcock b kay j worsley l moody m corry a titterrell a sheridan s borthwick a hazell m dawson h paul b cohen p elhorga c dominici b liebenberg d traille j marlu y delaigue d yachvili s marconnet s bruno n mas f pelous capt j thion s betsen j bonnaire s chabal w servat j milloud g lamboley y nyanga p mignoni f michalak j p grandclaude paddy o brien new zealand
wilkinson to miss ireland match england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goal kicker jonny wilkinson according to his newcastle boss rob andrew wilkinson who had targeted the february match for his international comeback has been missed by england not least for his goal kicking jonny s not fit yet falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live he wo n t be fit for dublin there s no doubt about that but he might be fit for scotland and italy the year old has not played for england since the world cup final after a succession of injuries england who have lost three six nations games in a row wasted a half time lead in their defeat to france goal kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop goal between them they ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley added andrew a former england fly half and goal kicker they re both pretty good kickers charlie is a good kicker week in week out but it s all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment andrew also blamed england s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high profile retirements and injuries they just did n t have that leadership that would have seen them through martin johnson lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations he said i think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full back meanwhile former england full back dusty hare put england s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness jonny wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an kicking success rate hare told bbc radio five live but natural born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts hodgson who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late the top golfers do n t hit the fairway every time and it is the same with goal kicking hare added you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over but great goal kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely
italy wales wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six try victory in rome tries from jonathan thomas tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a half time advantage luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second half efforts from brent cockbain shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory fly half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year s tournament starting full of confidence after their victory over england the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short the ball was switched left and michael owen s long cut out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run in stephen jones who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson s heroics against england slotted an excellent conversion from wide out wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass and italy hit back out of the blue in the th minute henson sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england beat two players with ease out on the left touchline but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner with the welsh line out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors scrum the home side s forward power brought them back into it but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch wales regained control with a second try in the st minute henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his th test try jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy henson was also narrowly short with a long range effort at goal but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off loaded to martyn williams the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post jones adding the conversion italy who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half time built up a head of steam on the resumption de marigny landed a penalty to make it and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock on but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour their fourth after minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams who beat several players with ease and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain before italy could recover from that blow a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over with jones converting both for a lead wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe but after back to back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in years they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders r de marigny mirco bergamasco w pozzebon a masi l nitoglia l orquera a troncon a lo cicero f ongaro m castrogiovanni s dellape m bortolami capt a persico mauro bergamasco s parisse g intoppa s perugini ca del fava d dal maso p griffen m barbini kp robertson g thomas capt h luscombe t shanklin g henson s williams s jones d peel g jenkins m davies a jones b cockbain r sidoli j thomas m williams m owen r mcbryde j yapp i gough r sowden taylor g cooper c sweeney k morgan andrew cole australia

kuznetsova failed a drugs test us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug according to belgian authorities belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on december kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time eerdekens said there is a problem ephedrine was discovered she remains innocent until proved guilty she can ask for it to be tested again the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti doping agency wada the international tennis federation itf or the women s tennis accosiation wta the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested speaking at the australian open on monday before eerdekens identified her kuznetsova said i m not worried i m not using anything to push myself i have not been notified of any positive test and i think it is unfair that it s come out the way it did eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player s address in spain as well as to the belgian prosecutors office and the belgian and russian tennis federations he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance we have simply stated a fact he said it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection however kuznetsova s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev first of all this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing without any basic evidence tarpishchev said we all know the basic principle in doping cases if there is a positive sample then they should notify the international tennis federation itf as well as the national federation within three days he said this is not the case here as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials nor did the itf today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it if wada the world anti doping agency was behind the testing then we would also have known something by now otherwise all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts

hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic five set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi finals hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a two set lead but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the th game and served out to win and set up a meeting with andy roddick the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitt s exuberant on court celebrations were not very good for the sport and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip and he double faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes i just kept hanging in there it was always tough serving second in the fifth set said hewitt who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again it s a long way from holding that trophy up there but i m hanging in there only four guys left that can win and we re the top four in the world it s set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals

williams battles to aussie title serena williams staged a remarkable recovery to beat lindsay davenport and win her second australian open title the champion claimed her seventh grand slam title and her first since wimbledon in williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games she quickly dropped the first set but from in the second found another gear as davenport s game collapsed allowing williams to take the title williams later explained her injury problem saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually i was able to come back thank goodness she said davenport paid tribute to williams saying she s had a tough couple of years and she s come back like a champion the year old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second i kept thinking to myself i m not losing this game said williams afterwards i do n t care if my arm falls off i m not losing this game and i guess that s what happened i did n t want to lose that particular game because it would have given her a lot of momentum and a lot of confidence despite letting the break points slip away davenport looked comfortable enough at but from up she just folded williams won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as a lacklustre davenport looked to have run out of energy after a gruelling two weeks i felt like i was playing well and in control pretty much of the match said davenport then i just had that horrible lapse i think serving up and made a few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it at the end i think i was a little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going she s a great frontrunner when she gets going

connors rallying cry for british tennis do you have it in your heart how much guts do you have how much do you hate to lose these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain s brightest tennis hopes in the months and possibly years to come the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce a long term relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga and the man who epitomised the phrase will to win before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey you know everybody hits the ball well and there s a very fine line between number one and number said connors i was that fine line for a long time but if i can help i want to be part of teaching kids how to win connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the lta his long time rival john mcenroe has repeatedly done the same but connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of lta performance director david felgate and his team britain has a different attitude the right attitude in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion said connors that s something you do n t find every day everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect the impression i came away with after just seeing david and the other coaches for three days was one like i ve never seen before especially over here this is not going to happen overnight there are no miracle workers but you re going in the right direction the year old s enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america i ve had discussions with the usta united states tennis association over a number of years he said that s where it my input ended connors is a straight talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the lta and the cream of britain s young players if they re chosen they ve got to produce he said if not someone will come and take their place there s only one number one spot and it s lonely up there but it s got the best view in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britain s great new hope connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon tim henman has a whole country on his shoulder said connors i do n t know that pressure but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level someone s going to have to come and take over from him henman if i was andrew murray i d embrace that that s what we play for despite the emphasis on hard work training and preparation connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within the passion i had i do n t know if you can find that he admitted i was also nuts i say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court it was the most important thing in the world for me and to do that something s got to be not right with you there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of people what i had when i played tennis is what i am you have to have that you ca n t be moulded
