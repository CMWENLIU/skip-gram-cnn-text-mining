redford s vision of sundance despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star struck crowds at sundance it s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city utah back in the s now in its twenty first year sundance continues to grow some people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind it s an opportunity to meet and make deals redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film makers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundance s limelight but redford is not worried the more the merrier he says the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them once independent film had a place where the work could be seen suddenly the merchants came with them the celebrities came then the paparazzi and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone explains redford people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film he adds international film makers have always been celebrated here but is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect particularly how the us is perceived internationally he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration it s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration he says i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view that s very unhealthy and very dangerous if we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences sundance is n t just one big screening there are discussion panels and q a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like america s culture wars and the iraq war while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic educated middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum anti war and socially liberal but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience when you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian and it s about good films and good story telling be it african america asian women gay lesbian sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say it s just a film by so and so
dvd review harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake up that really shines on dvd gone are the warm bright colours found in the two earlier films alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous and looks even better here than in the cinema it is all part of the progression of harry s story into darker areas but you ll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted as they always are by a calamity that only harry ron and hermione can put right it sounds corny but harry is no longer the winsome hero he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well emma watson is ever better as hermione and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd but it is laden with behind the scenes extras including funny if shallow interviews with all the main cast but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it as we did on the first harry potter dvd the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene a short featurette about the making of the film s big moments

dvd review spider man it s a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good but spider man breaks that rule in two it s not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning a few effects look false but tobey maguire kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film then there are commentaries trailers and a blooper reel sometimes quality comes in bulk this set contains no less than john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man now is that a christmas present or what give this to someone on december and you wo n t see them again until early in the new year it s not truly a complete collection and leans more toward wayne s earlier films there s no true grit for instance though there is hellraisers the films look well transferred to dvd though none has extras it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous series became a cult favourite that s been long awaited on dvd this set has the first season of buck gil gerard and wilma s erin gray tongue in cheek adventures and it s all as camp and gaudy as you remember but it s also a disappointment the us dvd has this and the more po faced second season and you can import it for just about the same price the bigger omission though is that there are no extras that s particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them

dance music not dead says fatboy dj norman cook aka fatboy slim has said that dance music is not dead but has admitted it is currently going through a fallow patch the commercial failure of the latest albums by britain s two biggest dance acts fatboy slim s palookaville and the prodigy s always outnumbered never outgunned has been coupled with the closure of many superclubs and the folding of three dance music magazines last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize with the brits committee announcing that dance music is no longer where it s happening in music these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album halfway between the gutter and the stars but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over every week when i was making the album i was reading articles about the demise of dance music and obviously that affects you somewhat he told bbc world service s the ticket programme i personally do n t believe it s either dead or going to die but it s going through a bit of a fallow patch so i think consciously or subconsciously reading every week that dance music was dead i would think right scrub that track then although his album sales in the uk are down palookaville stayed in the uk top for just three weeks cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties and event on brighton sea front in attracted people while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year with a crowd that big if the weather s nice the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think i ve got them cook said i m always really really nervous before the big ones they had to give me valium before rio because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor for some reason especially now i ve got a reputation for it the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that s already going on means all i have to do is play up records he promised more such parties in more locations around the world despite problems after the brighton event which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt one man also died of a heart attack and a woman fell to her death during the free party we re having to widen our horizons from just beaches because there s landlocked countries that want to get involved cook said we re doing rio at the carnival at the maracana and sao paolo our new gig is famous football stadiums the dj admitted however that his massive worldwide success had a downside with intense media interest in his personal life in particular he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break up of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball after she was linked with dj dan peppe the tabloid thing has been difficult at times cook said especially the me and zoe gate it s quite scary he said that he had been determined that what had happened with ball did not affect the album at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people would n t think i was depressed he explained then i thought that s not right and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended i said to zoe i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me do you mind if it s on the album he recalled she said yeah it s hilarious because your masochistic baby did leave you cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on where paul mccartney is a neighbour it s almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs cook explained if there s a pap at the end of the road everyone knocks on each other s doors paul comes round and we warn him because we do n t know who they re after

csi shows give unrealistic view people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows real experts say evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes at a time when many have large backlogs science investigators claim lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc crime scene investigation csi and its spin offs csi miami and csi new york have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic each episode a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science and the extensive resources at their disposal the csi effect is basically the perception of the near infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show said max houck who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university us this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it including the cops and prosecutors and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the american forensics expert said there were roughly backlogged dna samples in us labs yet these constituted just of the total test backlog said dr houck forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the show s influence in dealing with the families of victims what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case she explained for example on television the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously but when people find out that it can take several months they can find that very difficult dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people s perceptions the show s influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom making lawyers jittery prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because for example they wonder why was n t everything tested well in fact not everything needs to be tested dr houck explained defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut this objective method that s always accurate however he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field my university course started with four graduates in we re now the largest major on campus with students he said dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level there s more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research

u s desire to be number one u who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive if not always groundbreaking but such success is down to more than music they have to be compelling performers charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground they also have to want it they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it the beatles had it the rolling stones still have it rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit and u have it in spades and keep churning it out their new album how to dismantle an atomic bomb comes years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all time rock a list they may have lost some of the edginess and raw youthful force that propelled them to the top but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums vertigo the first single from the new album went straight into the uk singles chart at number one knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their th top hit the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better to make records the whole world will listen to bono recently said drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments we re very competitive we want to be on the radio have big singles we do n t want to be thought of as a veteran band the band have done everything in their considerable powers to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world according to q magazine editor paul rees this makes them hugely determined and formidable he added they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up as such they ve constantly re invented and challenged themselves they are perhaps alone as the only rock band that has got better with age the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised mr rees said they do everything in the right way the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board attracting fellow pupils paul hewson bono vocals adam clayton bass david evans the edge guitar and his brother dick dick evans soon dropped out and the four piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u by they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager paul mcguinness they were brilliant but very coarse mcguinness recently said in a way they were doing exactly what they do now only badly they struggled to attract record company attention later being described as pretty damn average and strange and eerie by scouts who saw them live they released two ireland only singles which topped the national charts in and leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy the stadium filling anthemic sound was u s aim from the start and their third album war saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic going to number one in the uk and in the us songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year s day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band which bono rejected as a cliche his stage performances which included flag waving speaker climbing and drum throwing earned him a reputation as an electric performer and their appearance at s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom in the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name i still have n t found what i m looking for and with or without you those songs took the band s epic atmospheric sound to a simple powerful and popular pinnacle the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music plus wildly extravagant stage shows while still trying to retain their mass appeal the achtung baby album in was followed by zooropa pop and their corresponding stadium tours which featured giant olives flying cars live phone calls to the white house and bono s transformation into alter egos the fly and macphisto he was also building a parallel reputation not always to the pleasure of his bandmates as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb they had sold million albums around the world but they still want more

german music in a zombie state the german music business the third largest in the world is in the state of a zombie because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy a leading industry figure has said tim renner the head of universal music germany until last year told bbc world service s the music biz programme that the country s music industry was now struggling to survive renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties such as downloading its decline could become irreversible the problem the music industry has got is that they are n t willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out he stated so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie the music market in germany peaked in with sales of bn euros bn since sales have plummeted to just bn euros bn in in the space of one year between and cd album sales fell by but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold mr renner pointed out that because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good selling record this was particularly damaging you need time he added however peter zombic the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as mr renner believed it s quite true that we have severe problems in germany but that s true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too he argued we have a severe problem with piracy especially internet piracy and we also have a severe problem of private copying i do n t agree that the music industry lost control over the music market in fact especially in regard to germany talent the market is quite successful he did however admit that copyright owners have partly lost control of their copyright due to piracy and copying but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading we were the first to implement a download service back in he argued at that time it was not successful because of the advent of piracy it was the napster time when pp services became popular it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends without fear of breaking copyright mr zombic said that this legal framework was a huge problem there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby it s nice it s fun he added we try to make clear it s not nice and it s not fun it s endangering the creativity in our country

music man to the oscars bill conti s job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate spinning assignment this year marks conti s th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra the excitement is a live performance as a musician he says all of your colleagues everyone in the film industry is in the theatre all the important people i guess it s just a television show but we always think it s a bit more the orchestra strikes up more than times during the average oscars show as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house it s a very busy evening it takes a certain amount of preparation of music orchestrating sketching rehearsing before the show but you do n t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director it s exciting explains conti and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed we do n t know who the winners will be so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds conti the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches despite being told to be brief by the show s producers the decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the director s box to the orchestra via conti s earpiece i do n t feel good about it at all it s not my call though he says when the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall we do n t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off the person that s been cut off who s feet from me is glaring at me like it s death time on occasions some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak julia roberts when she came on she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says conti received an oscar in for the original score of the right stuff he also received two nominations in the original song category in for gonna fly now from rocky and in for the title song from for your eyes only it s a moment in the sun he says when people get up there some people this is hard to believe people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining might get a little flustered but there s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories behind the scenes the key players such as conti have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with there s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls i can control hearing in my ears the left ear or the right ear different things at different times i have to communicate with the director i have a little microphone that s attached to my headset to open up that microphone i have a footswitch he explains conti s most nerve wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke conti immediately told the show s director i start cursing and screaming i tell him we re not going to die for this show you must do something or i m going to climb out of this pit with musicians and we re going to be home in minutes oh no bill do n t do anything came the response imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra or so of them in the pit and while we re playing firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands no one died it s not a big story but it was scary at the time laughs conti when the ceremony is over the music director attends the annual governor s ball with his family i have a drink and relive the show he says i m not for too much carousing i go home and unwind it takes me about a day

bangkok film festival battles on organisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this year s event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster the festivities have been scaled down red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund apart from this however the festival has continued as originally planned when the disaster happened we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel said the festival s executive director craig prater the decision was made that we would continue but that the focus would change our premieres became fundraisers the opening night was visibly toned down and of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund he continued but we feel like we ve turned a page we ve acknowledged our position and now it s business as usual mr prater s sentiments were echoed by christine rush director of the festival s sister event the bangkok film market we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nation s recovery from this terrible disaster she said however the nation s recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out she added given the conspicuously low audience figures that support may be more symbolic than significant however poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties the eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake that said the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers on a more positive note the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city problems securing air transport the clash with last sunday s golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher alongside such screen stars as michael douglas jeremy irons and jean claude van damme irons whose film being julia is in competition for the festival s golden kinnaree awards said he had wondered whether he should attend after december s catastrophe i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened the british actor said i thought it might be in rather bad taste but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on now i ve come here i m very glad what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west he continued basically i was invited here by thailand if they still want you to come you should now in its third year bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong tokyo and pusan in south korea mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal it s grown awfully fast in three years maybe too fast he concedes we ve had some bumps in the road but that s only because the festival is still a baby i have no doubt in my mind that in five years this will be the top asian film festival in the world the golden kinnarees will be awarded on friday the festival itself runs until january

oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer less contentious cinema if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches two of the front runners would have had to be michael moore s bush baiting documentary fahrenheit and mel gibson s the passion of the christ both films polarised opinion but had critics talking and the public turning up to see them fahrenheit breaking us box office records for a documentary and the passion of the christ making more than us m m in the us alone but this year s academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies with the passion of the christ a film accused of being anti semitic receiving nominations only in the minor categories of cinematography makeup and musical score fahrenheit has also been overlooked despite winning the palme d or at the cannes international film festival in moore s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors decision to enter it in the best picture category rather than best documentary says tim dams the news editor of trade magazine screen international but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore s film does not sit well with the academy if you look at past oscar winners and nominees the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative epic style pictures fahrenheit did n t really fit in to that category they tend to go for films like titanic gladiator and the lord of the rings films with scale that often are n t too contentious he said while he said the oscar voting panel were not snubbing moore s film he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category i think it s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub he said the problem with mel gibson s film he believed was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic an ancient middle eastern language hollywood does n t tend to like foreign language films no one s ever tried doing a film in a dead language he said but aside from these two films some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations the german film the downfall a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker has been recognised in the best foreign film category the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man rather than a semi mythical historical monster but mr dams said it s not an inflammatory film it has done very well in germany and it s a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster another contentious film mr dams said has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm independent film maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its super size portions in the us after he went on a month long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals and filmed his progress the film has been a hit around the world mr dams said it s a political film but it s quite fun and punky and well paced morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy it s a very accessible film and it does n t beat you over the head with its views while in fahrenheit there are moments of comedy i think the way that super size me is put together the fact it s a very likeable film means it s won through on charm dam s pick at this year s oscars the aviator martin scorsese s biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes tinseltown it seems likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own

us afflicted with awards fatigue the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema goers and the tv viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies according to some la film critics bob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates a celebrity love in this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic as chris rock accurately said they re about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner unsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue but entertainment weekly s dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster such as titanic or lord of the rings was nominated the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt on thursday the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry related news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win screen international s us editor mike goodridge thinks s films have simply not grabbed the public s imagination film makers have n t produced films that people adore this year he said they adored saving private ryan for example people loved it and it made a ton of money s films could be a reaction to there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all audiences do n t necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby aviator and finding neverland which end with casualty as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopeful mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added i m all for lower ratings though there are far more important things going on than the oscars mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rock s humour could prompt america s conservative states to switch off so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would win clint eastwood s million dollar baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorsese s aviator and million dollar baby mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments i hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said after all it s still one of the biggest tv events of the year
critics back aviator for oscars martin scorsese s the aviator will win best film at the oscars according to the uk s leading movie critics but several of those surveyed by the bbc news website think

respectively the jury comprised experts and critics from the top uk film publications the panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win all expect the aviator to win best film but many think it will be a close race between scorsese s howard hughes biopic and eastwood s boxing drama million dollar baby the other films nominated are wine comedy sideways factual drama finding neverland and ray charles biopic ray i m pretty sure this is the year of the aviator though my own choice would be sideways said the observer s philip french sideways should win but it does n t have a hope said jamie graham of total film a position shared by film presenter jonathan ross the form going in to the oscars points to the aviator but i liked million dollar baby more said tim dams news editor of trade weekly screen international five of the eight critics tipped scorsese to win best director with mr dams heat s charles gant and empire s angie errigo plumping for eastwood sideway s alexander payne ray s taylor hackford and british director mike leigh nominated for period drama vera drake are considered outsiders in this category up until recently i could have sworn scorsese would get it just for being scorsese ms errigo told the bbc news website but i m beginning to think eastwood will get it i d be very happy for mike leigh to win but i do n t think he has any chance said charles gant film editor of heat foxx s portrayal of ray charles has already seen him win prizes at the golden globes baftas and screen actors guild awards mr dams said this made him out and out favourite to be named best actor on oscar night everyone would be incredibly surprised if he did n t win he said if you re a betting man he s as close as you get to a certainty if paul giamatti was nominated for sideways it would be a different game says total film s jamie graham but foxx will and should win with vera drake star imelda staunton nominated for best actress alongside kate winslet britain has a good chance of victory on paper jonathan ross for one will be very happy if winslet wins for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but while wendy ide of the times still thinks staunton has a chance heat s charles gant believes her bafta win will cut little ice with academy voters i d like staunton to win but her chances are not that great said mr gant who predicted a second oscar for hilary swank i think swank will win said mr french imelda has got as far as she s going to get playing that role staunton is also the personal choice of steven gaydos executive editor of industry
