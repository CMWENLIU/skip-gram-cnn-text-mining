china had role in yukos split up china lent russia bn bn to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos it has been revealed the kremlin said on tuesday that the bn which russian state bank veb lent state owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long term oil supply deal with china the deal sees rosneft receive bn in credits from china s cnpc according to russian newspaper vedomosti these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk reports said cnpc had been offered of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long term oil supply deal instead analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos yugansk s former owner if cnpc had become a shareholder rosneft and veb declined to comment the two companies rosneft and cnpc have agreed on the pre payment for long term deliveries said russian oil official sergei oganesyan there is nothing unusual that the pre payment is for five to six years the announcements help to explain how rosneft a medium sized indebted and relatively unknown firm was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk yugansk was sold for bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky once the country s richest man mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china s desire to secure long term oil supplies to feed its booming economy china s thirst for products such as crude oil copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage in russia said dmitry lukashov an analyst at brokerage aton they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies if the price of oil is fixed under the deal which is unlikely it could be very profitable for the chinese mr lukashov continued and rosneft is in desperate need of cash so it s a good deal for them too

why few targets are better than many the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world s leading economy by but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe does n t become a global economic laggard they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the united states that s why there was a tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets five years on from their inception his conclusion was simple too many of the targets will be seriously missed lisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said the status quo is not an option at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built it said the report comes at a time when europe s competitive position is waning the eu s economic growth rate is projected to be this year and next while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe productivity lags behind that of the us but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years as mr kok s report noted the ink had scarcely dried on the lisbon agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit the circumstances were n t conducive to creating the million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so called knowledge based economy the lisbon vision is a compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council a brussels based citizen action group what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change you find trade unions fighting change but also the employers associations even though they tell you they re in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they covered too much according to the wim report economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the kok report said everybody is responsible and thus no one that s why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they re taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming rhetoric and delivery do n t necessarily go hand in hand mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report we do n t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another on one point mr kok was very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy the european economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth in that sense the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth it s very ambitious said john palmer political director at the european policy centre a brussels based think tank this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do it s going to require quite new and innovative policies but some analysts believe that the kok report does n t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality for example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce but it does n t say how companies should be convinced to do this it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr kok s recommendations and press them on eu governments mr barroso has said that the eu s competitiveness will be his top priority he expects his five year term in office to be judged on europe s success in meeting the lisbon agenda

gsk aims to stop aids profiteers one of the world s largest manufacturers of hiv aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills supplied to poorer african countries back into europe for resale at far higher price the company glaxosmithkline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies they want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti aids drugs to the world s poorest nations the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv positive africans through their government s health care systems but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re selling them at a higher price glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re sold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade glaxo says distribution of the new look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe

cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s convertible peso will from november be subject to a tax cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in cuba will be affected critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise in a live television broadcast announcing the measure president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states increasing economic aggression the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country he said the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months president bush s government which has been a strong supporter of the year old trade embargo on cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash says jose barrionuevo head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home this money known as remittances can amount to as much as bn a year those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate however many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there cuba s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the un economic commission for latin america is now worth bn to the country the tax is designed to provide much needed revenue for cuba s cash strapped economy cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine much of cuba s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair in recent weeks cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island cuba s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise however a decline in foreign tourism since periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government s economic problems the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading mr barrionuevo said the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries like venezuela which have restrictions on capital he says mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long

making your office work for you our mission to brighten up your working lives continues and this time we re taking a long hard look at your offices over the next few months our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient more congenial or simply prettier this week we re hearing from marianne petersen who is planning to convert a barn in sweden into a base for her freelance writing work click on the link under her photograph to read her story and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say and if you want to take part in the series go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch working from home presents a multitude of challenges understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done do you build on the ideas of others or are you a more introspective problem solver in order for a virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like minded people may assist it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water and weather tight and the structure is checked for stability it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn this would also allow for a well insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate ideally it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in a light colour the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn as for lighting consider a combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne s barn the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible a wireless router access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in a weak signal strength you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area your local it supplier will be able to advise on this if you have n t already invested in robust firewall and anti virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor or you could use one of the new tablet computers which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built in hand recognition software and finally you will save money and space by considering a multi function product for print scan copy and fax
market unfazed by aurora setback as the aurora limped back to its dock on january a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble and its owner p o cruises now part of the huge us carnival corporation was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year s profits and a potential pr fiasco no one however seems to have told the stock markets the warning of a five cent hit to earnings came just hours after one of the world s biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival s share price from to other investors barely blinked and by gmt carnival s shares in london were down a single penny or at why the mismatch between the public perception and the market s response the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time says deutsche bank s simon champion it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company it was a long cruise after all but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one off events despite its string of bad luck he pointed out aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet the uk s p o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in and generally speaking carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule carnival has an incredibly strong track record mr champion similarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise that should mitigate some of the pr risk both for carnival and its main competitor royal caribbean while not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday moreover such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises after all the aurora incident may be big news in the uk but for carnival customers elsewhere it s unlikely to make too much of a splash assuming that citigroup is right and demand stays solid the structure of the industry also works in carnival s favour in the wake of p o princess s takeover by carnival the business is now to a great extent a duopoly given the expense of building outfitting and running a cruise ship slowing supply growth is a certainty said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday in other words if you do want a cruise your options are limited and with carnival remaining the market leader it looks set to keep selling the tickets no matter what happens to the ill fated aurora in the future
the ticking budget facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial the washington based economic policy institute which tends to be critical of the president looks at possible fault lines us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come under direct threat will be the federal government s ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund as soon as the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in years by conservative estimates to more than half the nation s total annual output this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business even now a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china among other nations this does not bode well for us influence in the world the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue the dollar is already sinking before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards that will be the shock interest sensitive industries will feel pain immediately sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late s there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget the public outcry will force congress to act whether it will act wisely is another matter how did this happen by definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending but this neutral description does n t adequately capture the current situation federal revenues are at s levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades much higher in addition the united states has two significant military missions the bush administration s chosen remedy is the least feasible one reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem indeed if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left law enforcement space exploration environmental clean up economic development the small business administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear it s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed the biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor to some extent increases in these areas are inevitable the us population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world but serious savings can only be found where the big money is savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill serve the nation s elderly and indigent on the revenue side the lion s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since will have to be replaced some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes finally blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned there is no good reason to fixate on it anyway moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts second should be a dispassionate re evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism third must be the start of a serious debate on large scale health care reform one thing is certain destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century

booming markets shed few tears the market former british government minister michael heseltine once said has no morality and indeed stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week s disaster stock markets in indonesia and india have hit all time highs this week even in sri lanka more comprehensively affected the main index has lost only since the waves hit bigger markets further afield have barely twitched the msci world share index a measure of global stock market performance hit its highest level this week since early the bbc global has risen by in the past week and this at a time when all sentiment aside insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts in fact the markets are being perfectly rational for a start the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance according to estimates from india only one quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance and only one quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies indonesia is likely to have even lower take up rates and where insurance certainly is in place in for example the many tourist complexes affected the costs will be borne in far away corners of the global reinsurance market rather than landing locally second stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil technology and financial services none of which have been hit by the flooding tourist businesses the most likely sufferers are either foreign owned or too small to have their shares listed those that are listed have suffered confifi hotel holdings a small sri lankan tourism firm has halved in value this week but there are winners as well as losers asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities in indonesia shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week more broadly the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer term economic impact according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity there is rarely the centre says any sort of rebuilding boom but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided a study of the des moines floods from the disaster research center at the university of delaware found that of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster and another felt themselves better off although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale our research indicates that most businesses even those that are especially hard hit do indeed recover the authors concluded but disasters have a vast psychological impact and markets are driven by psychological factors in particular many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events in fact again the risks here are lower than they seem even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market currently trillion and rising a series of recent shocks the colorado centre has argued have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets the trillion dollar debts of japan s banks for example have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo and the us stock market was on its way down long before september it rose by during the six months following the attacks it is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings one bombay trader said this week but the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected business sense probably tends to overrule everything else

could yukos be a blessing in disguise other things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business but in the looking glass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true a new report has argued the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say the paper s reasoning is complex and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness after vladimir putin became president in he did not raise taxes but put a lot of effort too much critics argue into enforcement since then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach the report highlights the case of sibneft a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year after mr putin came to power the company s overall effective tax rate rose from to and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police but shareholders benefited hugely sibneft started to pay dividends m in and almost bn in and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds according to the authors although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers does this analysis make sense in part certainly for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and law abiding since companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges something unthinkable in the wilder days of the s and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts bn in and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities for a start the model assumes that the various parties have clearly defined motivation companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia connections often greased by bribery blur the apparently antagonistic relationship companies can for example persuade officials to overlook non payment of taxes and the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested a year ago the russian market has dropped by an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance

giving financial gifts to children your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs for example the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age through its new child trust fund the first vouchers worth or for low income families will be distributed from january all children born after st september will be eligible parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to a year which will grow free of income and capital gains tax as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children s deposit account and use this as a feeder fund there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest some of the best instant access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society paying for a minimum balance of and the alliance leicester firstsaver which pays also starting at interest earned by children is subject to income tax however children like adults have a personal income tax allowance for the current tax year if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives but not parents any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance then no tax will be payable when the account is opened a form r available from the bank or building society should be completed this confirms that the account holder is a non taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child only of interest per parent can be tax free where interest exceeds this level the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child consideration should be given to opening separate accounts one for parents gifts and one for gifts from other relatives therefore it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual limit being directed to a deposit account another favourite solution is premium bonds with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account they make great presents the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian the minimum for each purchase is and bonds are sold in multiples of there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored over the longer term stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment although in the shorter term they can be volatile one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term more than ten years which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares these funds may be actively managed where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential or passive where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index for example the ftse exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index so are really another form of tracker the difference is that the charges are quite low the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age and parents will have no control over how it is spent for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income

markets fall on weak dollar fears rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on monday after a finance ministers meeting and stern words from fed chief alan greenspan the london ftse fell while tokyo s nikkei dropped its steepest fall in three months g finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar whose slide could further jeopardise growth in japan and europe and mr greenspan warned asian states could soon stop funding the us deficit on monday afternoon the euro was close to an all time high against the dollar at above oil pushed higher too on monday as investors fretted about cold weather in the us and europe and a potential output cut from oil producers group opec although prices had cooled by the end of the day in london the benchmark brent crude price closed down cents at a barrel while new york light sweet crude closed down cents at a barrel the slide comes as the us has been attempting to talk up the traditional strong dollar policy the latest to pitch in has been president george w bush himself who told the asia pacific economic co operation apec summit in chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit together with a bn trade gap the red ink spreading across america s public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower and last week us treasury secretary john snow told an audience in the uk that the policy remained unaltered but he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar some had looked to the g meeting for direction but mr snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda for the us government letting the dollar drift is a useful short term fix us exports get more affordable helping perhaps to close the trade gap in the meantime the debt keeps getting bigger with congress authorising an bn rise in what the us can owe taking the total to trillion but in a speech on friday federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky at present much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to asian states such as japan and china since the dollar is seen as the world s reserve currency similarly asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account the deficit between what the us as a whole spends and what it earns but already they are turning more cautious an auction of debt in august found few takers and mr greenspan said that could turn into a trend if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments it seems persuasive that given the size of the us current account deficit a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point he said

turkey turns on the economic charm three years after a gruelling economic crisis turkey has dressed its economy to impress as part of a charm offensive ahead of december when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks turkey s economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements the economy is growing fast they insist education levels among its young and large population are rising unemployment levels in percentage terms are heading fast towards single digits inflation is under control a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to bn bn in three years moreover government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract bn of foreign investment over the next three years a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund imf is pretty much in the can and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent the point of all this has been to convince europe s decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits the cake will be bigger for everybody said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget if admitted into the eu turkey would contribute almost bn euros bn bn to its budget by according to a recent impact study by the country s state planning organisation as turkey s gross domestic output gdp is set to grow by per year on average its contribution would rise from less than bn euros in to almost bn euros by turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in old europe once its population comes of age by one in four turks or about million people will be aged or less a literate and qualified turkish population insisted mr sener will make a positive impact on the eu this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers wallets however turkey s assertions are confirmed by brussels own impact studies which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy but only over time costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey s membership with subsidies alone estimated to exceed bn euros and according to some predictions balloon to bn euros this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid though such payments should decline as the country s farm sector which currently employs one in three turks would employ just one in five by such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey s government would never be delivered say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned some fear that rather than providing an educated sophisticated labour force for europe at large the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor uneducated and plentiful more recently less palatable concerns at least in liberal european circles have been voiced with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a river of islam an oriental culture and a threat to europe s cultural richness of course many opponents are politically motivated their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country s muslim traditions to well documented concerns about the government s human rights record yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey s economic roadmap has been over egged an argument amplified by a rise in the country s current account deficit to bn during the first months of this year the country s massive debt which includes bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu in the new member states of the european union gross public debt is typically about of gross domestic product says reza moghadam assistant director of the imf s european department at about of gdp turkey s gross debt is double that figure turkey s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in caused the country s devastating recession there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past it remains quite vulnerable says michael deppler director of the imf s european department its debt is far too high for an emerging economy a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria but economics is not a science and although the state of turkey s economy is important as is its pace of reform the final decision on december will be taken by politicians who will of course be guided by their political instincts

japan s ageing workforce built to last in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties and the year old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life mr toshitsune is one of japan s centenarians a club that is growing by annually and where the oldest member is at his neat osaka detached house where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony between tasks this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is well what s most important for me is to be japan s number one mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone and when it comes to longevity japan as a country appears to be doing just that women can expect to live until men until four years longer than americans and europeans on the outskirts of kyoto year old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends who are in their seventies i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved he remarks on average we can live longer whether it s the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes japan s elderly are remarkable but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead japan is the world s least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us by japan s population is expected to peak at million then shrink to under million by the middle of the century this means million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled in the year if the birth rate remains the same people over will make up over of the population explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo so how will japan s finances stay on track after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about of the country s gross domestic product gdp the highest rate among industrialised countries the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from the cost of running japan s welfare state will double to more than of gdp while current account balances will deteriorate by over but unfortunately japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically glen wood vice president of deutsche securities japan asks who s going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york s statue of liberty but as yet japan is not ready for an ellis island japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it s an option that s becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists mr wood in japan as in europe which also faces a workforce decline immigration is a very sensitive subject but for the japanese economy facing fewer consumers by means slumping domestic sales of cars hi tech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash of course the japanese could always have more children the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia but there would be no pay back until when today s babies are taxpayers and the demographic crisis like in europe starts to unfold in in contrast to japan and of course the european union the us population is expected to increase by to million by the middle of the century although president bush must re devise social security to take account of a rise in america s over s the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market they want a shift towards financial services though doubts persist over the country s ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing japan still has problems getting a viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semi conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says mr wood japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency come japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power there are fears that the world s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession but none of this is mr toshitsune s concern anymore at he chuckles that he feels fine

fresh hope after argentine crisis three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis there is fresh hope the country s economy is set to grow about this year after seeing growth last year a sharp turnaround from when output fell the unemployment rate is improving too it is set to slip below by the end of the year down from in may true problems remain but the overall picture is one of vast improvement even the international monetary fund imf admits this the argentine authorities are proud should be proud of the strong performance of the economy thomas dawson an imf director said earlier this month argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which at least initially was made worse by the government s decisions pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country s massive debts in response angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month argentina was on the brink of collapse the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso s decade long peg to the us dollar in february the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people s life savings disappear scathes of companies went bust three years ago every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur drayton valentine it really was dire but since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur drayton valentine mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina was fortunate at the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad but now he is using his money to help with the start up a trading company he explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market locally there is a sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that a lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are re opening but not all that shines is gold argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of president nestor kirchner s administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts nominal value standing at around bn it is not proving easy debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate argentina s current offer implies that the creditors would get just cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending for president kirchner this proves a hopeless challenge real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed jack boorman adviser to imf s managing director rodrigo rato everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached he said the cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuring with the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina said carlos baez silva president of aara an association that represents bank account and bond holders few people have recovered more than about half their savings mr baez silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe a lot of them invested in good faith he said the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country s legal system on occasion the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted people have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina agreed if i have to save pesos the local currency there
