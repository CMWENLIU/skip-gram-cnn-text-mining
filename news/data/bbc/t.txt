ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic a small mountainous state of the former soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population in an effort to live up to its reputation in the s as an island of democracy the kyrgyz president askar akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid s with a hastily pushed through referendum in reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with deputies the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections the german embassy the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated the ink is sprayed on a person s left thumb it dries and is not visible under normal light however the presence of ultraviolet light of the kind used to verify money causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light at the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voter s fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have his her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics notably ukraine and georgia the use of ink has been controversial especially among groups perceived to be pro government widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems others such as the aggressively middle of the road coalition of non governmental organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as serbia south africa indonesia and turkey the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink but as the elections in afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems the use of invisible ink is not without its own problems in most elections numerous rumors have spread about it in serbia for example both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward however in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off the ink stays on the finger for at least hours and for up to a week the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills the passage of the inking law is nevertheless a clear step forward towards free and fair elections the country s widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for february david mikosz works for the ifes an international non profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies

digital guru floats sub pc nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit s media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries he said one laptop per child could be very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family village and neighbourhood he said the child could use the laptop like a text book he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linux based operating system we have to get the display down to below to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel the second trick is to get rid of the fat if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money in mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital now widely seen as predicting the digital age the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on while the idea was popular amongst the children it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops we put in laptops three years ago only one has been broken the kids cherish these things it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine not just a textbook mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious nokia make million cell phones a year so for us to claim we re going to make million laptops is a big number but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years we re talking about months he plans to be distributing them by the end of and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order in china they spend per child per year on textbooks that s for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away
technology gets the creative bug the hi tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision but that dance is growing more intimate as hi tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration and vice versa uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative the idea says bt is to shape a st century model which will help cement the art technology and business worlds together we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology said frank stone head of the bt s business sector programmes he looks after several centres of excellence which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations one of which is focused on creative industries to mark the initiative s launch a major international art installation is to open on april in brussels with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer they have both been created using the telco s technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm including a sophisticated graphics rendering program using a d graphics engine the type commonly used in gaming bafta winning artists langlands bell have created a virtual story based d model of brussels coudenberg cellars they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace an historical seat of european power the d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the th century the river was integral to the city s survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared said the artists we hope that by uncovering the river we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present and appreciate the flow of modernity once concealing but now revealing the river senne in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering game ai and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game they are so time consuming and expensive to create the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics intensive games bt s own engine tara total abstract rendering architecture has been in development since and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners it was also used in in encounter an urban based pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical on the street action because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new and many keen coders designers games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself as more tools for self expression are given to the person on the street enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance creativity will become an integral part of technology the orange expressionist exhibition last year for example displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential not least because it gives people something to do with their technology big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too the art world is fantastically rich said mr stone with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them between and the creative industry brought billion to london alone it is an industry that is growing by a year too the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net according to mr stone this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online he said it is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem with broadband penetration reaching in the uk businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries or more patent ideas for tech companies what we are trying to do is have outside in thinking we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy said mr stone

google s toolbar sparks concern search engine firm google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre selected commercial websites the autolink feature comes with google s latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazon com if it finds a book s isbn number on the site it also links to google s map service if there is an address or to car firm carfax if there is a licence plate google said the feature available only in the us adds useful links but some users are concerned that google s dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon autolink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book s unique isbn number would link directly to amazon s website it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazon com whether they like it or not websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services dan gillmor founder of grassroots media which supports citizen based media said the tool was a bad idea and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta ie trial stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users it said the user can choose never to click on the autolink button and web pages she views will never be modified in addition the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time the new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any click through to a commercial site cory doctorow european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses but as an end user i would want to know can i choose to use this service how much is google being paid can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or tricked into using the service

finding new homes for old phones re using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment it has social benefits too research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites the report reveals that approximately million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk of the million that are swapped for newer models each year only get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re use the slowly growing mass of unrecycled discarded phones has now reached million handsets the equivalent of tonnes of waste estimates james goodman report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future it s quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around said mr goodman many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world said mr goodman far better he said to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life we ve heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back said mr goodman but there s a strong social argument too older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model the forum for the future report took an in depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular it s an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network said mr goodman and there s a real desire for people to get mobile phones but the relatively low wages in romania which is one of the poorest countries in europe mean few people can afford a shiny new phone the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one he said reconditioned handsets have boosted take up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one third of romanian pre pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets the re used handsets tend to be about one third of the price of a new handset georgeta minciu a romanian part time cleaner said normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages i am a single parent keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me this is the only way i can afford to have a phone she said mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain s mobile mountain made it overseas but he added those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it he said

intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade we ve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel s photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high volume manufacturing have been solved we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy to make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semi conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses it s a technical validation that it can work he said
security scares spark browser fix microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser the revamp has been prompted by microsoft s growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech savvy criminals test versions of the new program called ie are due to be released by the summer the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates microsoft chairman and chief software architect during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco although details were scant mr gates said ie would include new protections against viruses spyware and phishing scams this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes some of which were found in the ie browser microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti spyware program an own brand anti virus program is due to follow by the end of the decision to make internet explorer is widely seen as a u turn because before now microsoft said it had no need to update the browser typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows codenamed longhorn which is due to appear in the current version of internet explorer is four years old and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely according to market statistics gathered by websidestory firefox s market share is now about of all users however other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser internet explorer still dominates with a share of about but this is down from a peak of almost in mid
britons fed up with net service a survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service they are fed up with slow speeds high prices and the level of customer service they receive of readers have switched suppliers and a further are considering changing in the near future it is particularly bad news for bt the uk s biggest internet supplier with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining a third of the broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton editor of pc pro magazine we expect these figures to leap in every month the prices drop and more and more people are trying to switch he said the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription some readers were offered a price drop just p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator making it hardly worth while swapping other found themselves tied into month contracts broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all we discovered a huge variety of problems but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier said tim danton editor of pc pro this breaks the code of practice but because that code is voluntary there s nothing we or ofcom can do to help he said there is a vast choice of internet service providers in the uk now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages with prices set to drop even further in coming months mr danton advises everyone to shop around carefully if you just stick with your current connection then there s every chance you re being ripped off he warned
sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay as you go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour sun grid costs users p for an hour s worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun so called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed said sun s chief operating officer jonathan schwartz why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour he asked in a webcast launching sun s quarterly network computing event in california the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil gas and financial services industries some of them want to book computing capacity of more than processors each sun said mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment hundreds of servers were used simultaneously working on the problem for a few seconds each although it only took a few seconds the experiment cost because it had used up hour s worth of computing power the sun grid relies on solaris the operating system owned by sun initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm which argues that its capacity on demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun
lasers help bridge network gaps an indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country tata teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers offices and its own core network the laser bridges work across distances up to km and can be set up much faster than cable connections in months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than locations in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task said mr r sridharan vice president of networks at tata heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult he said in some locations he said permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get he said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs this has led chennai based tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between tata s core network and the premises of customers the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network the hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to gbps times faster than a kbps broadband connection but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of mbps the lasers are also ideal for india because of its climate it s particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it s hardly ever foggy he said in places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working said mr sridharan once we get the other permissions normal time period for set up is a few hours he said by contrast he said digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months this speed of set up has helped tata with its aggressive expansion plans just over months ago the firm had customers in only about towns and cities but by the end of march the firm hopes to reach more than speed is very important because of the pace of competition said mr sridharan

warnings about junk mail deluge the amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase say experts anti spam group spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent before now many spammers have recruited home pcs to act as anonymous e mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail the pcs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place in this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped steve linford director of spamhaus predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net s e mail sending infrastructure david stanley uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers they are adding to their armoury he said the amount of spam in circulation was still growing said mr stanley but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e mail meltdown but kevin hogan senior manager at symantec security response said such warnings were premature if something like this mean the end of e mail then e mail would have stopped two three years ago said mr hogan while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too mr hogan said of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses for instance said mr hogan filtering out e mail messages that contain a web link can stop about of spam
warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage however dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster the link to the website is contained in a spam e mail that is currently circulating the message s subject line reads urgent tsunami earthquake appeal and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts the web address of the fake site is decuk org which could be close enough to the official www dec org uk address to confuse some people keen to donate patricia sanders spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down she said the spam e mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation bt and dec s hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down she said ms sanders said sending out spam e mail to solicit donations was not dec s style and that it would never canvass support in this way she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed none of the e mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid one e mail sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud e mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile other scam e mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information in a monthly report anti virus firm sophos said that two e mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top hoax list during january another tsunami related e mail is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsoft s outlook e mail program anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to

open source leaders slam patents the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement mitchell kapor chairman of the mozilla foundation warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future linux is a freely available alternative to microsoft s windows it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made of its patents freely available other companies are expected to follow suit there are between and registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they ca n t afford to take them to court said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future if totally pushed to the wall because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software of course they re going to unleash the wmds mr kapor is reported as saying microsoft did not want to comment directly referring the issue instead to trade body intellect of which it is a member as far as intellect is concerned open source and patents have co existed for many years without problems said spokeswoman jill sutherland the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries and not be forced into using one or the other she added
reboot ordered for eu patent law a european parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new european union rules which govern computer based inventions the legal affairs committee juri said the commission should re submit the computer implemented inventions directive after meps failed to back it it has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open source software innovation supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention the draft law suffered setbacks when poland one of the largest eu member states rejected its adoption twice in two months intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure only two meps backed the draft law at the juri meeting with one voting to abstain opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the eu a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its one click shopping service for example critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us
solutions to net security fears fake bank e mails or phishing and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say e business experts trust in online security is falling as a result almost of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people the survey of more than people reported that were not willing to hand over personal information online it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm rsa which carried out the poll an estimated million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e commerce and e banking are being taken seriously by banks in particular i do n t think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website he added the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves if we do that they will indemnify us he said many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual s identity several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget last year a street survey found that more than of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate on average people have to remember four different passwords some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer in a separate survey by rsa said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems for many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard activcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one time passcode generation service users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for seconds many companies use a token based method already for employees to access networks securely already activcard s method is more complex it is currently trailing its one time passcode generation technology with uk banks steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as seconds before it changes it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction the clever bit happens back at the bank s secure servers the code is validated by the bank s systems matching the information they expect with the customer s unique key each individual gets a key which is unique to them it is a bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash it means that in a typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode by the time they go back to use the information the code has expired so they ca n t prove who they are according to mr ash in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants pdas and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said
mobile networks seek turbo boost third generation mobile g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the gsm world congress in cannes last week fast g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association at gsm siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second up to times faster than current g networks the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access a high speed high bandwidth technology available now early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than kilobits per second kbps on standard g networks high speed downlink packet access hsdpa sometimes called super g will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by uk based research consultancy analysys a number of companies are developing the technology nokia and canada based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide area networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of g with hsdpa and other enhancements the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic wcdma g he added motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor g cell using a single hsdpa device but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised ev do us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its g network at the end of last year we are expanding our network and deploying ev do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprint s vice president for technology development when the contract was announced as part of bn in multi year contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around bn on ev do technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of megabits a second and peak download rates of mbps mmo the uk based operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access hsdpa standard using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of mbps from next summer on its isle of man g network and will eventually support speeds of up to mbps us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of siemens in collaboration with the fraunhofer german sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band the speeds offered byg mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for g licences but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of megabits a second must faster than g this means users are likely to find g disappointing unless the networks are souped up if they are n t those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple antennae devices and conduct field trials a commercial system could be as far away as though siemens did not rule out an earlier date

no re draft for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re drafted by the european commission ec despite requests by meps the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect in other words computer implemented invention in a letter ec president jos manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament josep borrell that the commission did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council of ministers as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an insult to the assembly he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its one click shopping service for example critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe this they fear could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us
domain system scam fear a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers a trade body has warned the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet electronic task force but the uk internet forum ukif is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers says stephen dyer director of ukif domain names are the real language addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is a series of numbers they are used so people can more easily navigate the web so called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used so for example website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian a look just like an english a but the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be a fake this is more than just a theory a fake paypal com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name idn system said mr dyer as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent mr dyer said although the idn problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked said mr dyer it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site he added there are solutions for instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers another solution to introduce idn disabled browsers could be a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water he said centr the council of european national top level domain registries agrees a rush to introduce idn disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns a technology that is desperately needed in the non english speaking world the organisation said in a statement
cheaper chip for mobiles a mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful the specially designed chip developed by texas instruments could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of d gaming and frame a second video currently rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets the technology omap vox is being tested by firms in europe and asia and could appear by the end of the year texas which makes computer chips for more than half the world s mobile phones said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable we re going to drive them down into meat and potatoes phones that have the largest market share said doug rasor a marketing vice president at texas the chip also uses much less power than conventional chips said texas which means less strain on mobile battery life more than million people own a mobile in the uk but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more texas is keen to cash in on the third generation g of mobile technology which offers high speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions but it faces stiff competition from the likes of intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high end mobiles competition to get people using g mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the uk s operators have now launched third generation networks a recent survey by sony ericsson predicted that the number of g handsets sold in would double from to account for of all phones sold many consumers are still to be convinced though a further recent survey said that only of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to g phones many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard but there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks earlier in january ntt docomo and vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high speed networks known as super g intended to be times faster than g services the first stage of development is to be completed by but no date has been set for a commercial launch the newly designed omap vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference gsm which takes place in cannes france this week
blind student hears in colour a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps victor wong a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models a number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself mr wong told the bbc news website for the sake of my own study and for the sake of blind scientists generally i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot in order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used the software then assigns one of piano notes to individually coloured pixels ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it would n t work that well mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images
xbox may be unveiled in summer details of the next generation of microsoft s xbox games console codenamed xenon will most likely be unveiled in may according to reports it was widely expected that gamers would get a sneak preview of xbox s successor at the game developers conference gdc in march but a microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at gdc sony microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next months the next xbox console is expected to go on sale at the end of the year but very few details about it have been released it is thought that the machine may be unveiled at the electronic entertainment expo e in los angeles which takes place in may according to a reuters news agency report e concentrates on showing off the latest in gaming to publishers marketers and retailers the gdc is aimed more at game developers microsoft chief bill gates used the gdc event to unveil the original xbox five years ago since its launch microsoft has sold million units worldwide at the consumer electronics show earlier this year there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine in his keynote speech mr gates only referred to it as playing an essential part of his vision of the digital lifestyle but the battle between the rival consoles to win gamers hearts and thumbs will be extremely hard fought sony has traditionally dominated the console market with its playstation but earlier this year microsoft said it had reached a european milestone selling five million consoles since its european launch in march hit games like halo which was released in november helped to buoy the sales figures gamers are looking forward to the next generation of machines because they will have much more processing and graphical power they are also likely to pack in more features and technologies that make them more central as entertainment and communications hubs although details of playstation xenon and nintendo s so called revolution are yet to be finalised developers are already working on titles rory armes studio general manager for games giant electronic arts ea in europe recently told the bbc news website in an interview that ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines microsoft had delivered development kits to ea but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo s kits but he added the playstation was rumoured to have a little more under the hood than xbox
microsoft launches its own search microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home grown search engine the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november the revamped engine indexes more pages than before can give direct answers to factual questions and features tools to help people create detailed queries microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query keep up with news or search for images but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals such as yahoo and microsoft and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves this renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information be it for a particular web page recipe book gadget news story image or anything else microsoft is keen to make its home grown search engine a significant rival to google to generate its corpus of data microsoft has indexed billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days more often than rivals the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer for its direct answer feature microsoft is calling on its encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions facts calculations conversions and solutions to equations tony macklin director of product at ask jeeves pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since april the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search so in many ways microsoft is following the market he said tools sitting alongside the msn search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites countries regions or languages microsoft is also using so called graphic equalisers that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up to date or more popular the company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system the test or beta version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles on its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed

sporting rivals go to extra time the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on field action without ever moving from the couch the two giants in the field espn and ea sports have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years the latter is the world s largest games manufacturer years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed massively entertaining and ooze flair sports broadcaster espn meanwhile has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price but that status quo was changed forever or for the next years at least by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on air talent meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form it was a massive money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than virtual signatures many of those clicking to complain were already rankled for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america s national football league nfl so will the sega espn range be missed a key reason for answering yes is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste and having some options available always proves hugely handy online soccer fans will testify to that between bouts of arguing over which high profile title rules supreme out of the similar yet hugely different fifa and pro evolution soccer on the same note the espn k and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements taking hockey and basketball as examples both publishers efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible they also both look awesome with the sega espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front in terms of gameplay i marginally preferred ea s nba live for basketball and was more satisfied ice hockey wise by espn s nhl k the espn games are a touch more arcade like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into although like their rivals they also offer a dizzyingly extensive array of in game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die hard of sports fans perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea s future titles the front end decoration of ea s games has become something of an art form in itself loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv they are neat and excellent value games in their current form and combining them with ea s own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast

looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner more than million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date the figure was more than in and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in said analysts although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slow down in replacement sales all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years time they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner third generation mobiles g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who do n t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms more likely to drive sales in would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services the motorola razr v phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in she added this was not a women s thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self expression too it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi people are after something that is nice looking and together with that there is the entertainment side this year music will have a part to play in this the market for full track music downloads was worth just million million in but is set to be worth billion million by according to jupiter research sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w which combines a digital music player with up to hours battery life and a two megapixel camera in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life
yahoo celebrates a decade online yahoo one of the net s most iconic companies is celebrating its th anniversary this week the web portal has undergone remarkable change since it was set up by stanford university students david filo and jerry yang in a campus trailer the students wanted a way of keeping track of their web based interests the categories lists they devised soon became popular to hundreds of people and the two saw business potential in their idea originally dubbed jerry s guide to the world wide web the firm adopted the moniker yahoo because the founders liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude unsophisticated uncouth person the term was popularised by the th century satirist jonathan swift in his classic novel gulliver s travels we were certainly not sophisticated or civilised mr yang told reporters ahead of the anniversary which will be officially recognised on march they did have business brains however and in april persuaded venture capitalists sequoia capital which also invested in apple computer and cisco systems to fund yahoo to the tune of m m a second round of funding followed in the autumn and the company floated in april with less than employees now the firm employs workers and insists its dot com culture of work hard play hard still remains it is one of just a handful of survivors of the dot com crash although it now faces intense rivalry from firms such as google msn and aol jerry yang who remains the firm s chief yahoo is proud of what the company has achieved in just one decade the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything and it s been a remarkable and wonderful experience he said through it all we wanted to build products that satisfied our users wants and needs but it s even more than that it s to help every one of us to discover get more done share and interact
kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e slates the e slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver the data is transmitted alongside audio signals the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e slates it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it it also stores this on its hard disc the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project it s very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it s also a one way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux based system the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions users can scroll through these sections independently of each other eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world s largest university libraries all books in the public domain something like million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the e slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e slates says the project s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting as they need it most
tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones in the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone if you are not on the operator s portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it s a problem of how people discover your services he said to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of websites such as grumbletext co uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn people did not know they were being offered a subscription service we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk s phone firms everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox it s all about transparency he said consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it the consumer has a right to be protected he said christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that s done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said the new rules came in to force on january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said we do not have to say why we can just cut them off under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal stop command sent via text message he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn
creator of first apple mac dies jef raskin head of the team behind the first macintosh computer has died mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released he led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking the release of the mac reflected mr raskin s belief that good design should make computers easy to use mr raskin joined apple in as employee number initially to lead the company s publications department however in he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use the result was the macintosh that did away with the then common text based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing clicking and dragging although now in common use in almost all computers these methods were pioneering when first used in the macintosh the gui was developed by xerox parc and used in its star machine but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project so it would n t be here if it were n t for him said andy hertzfeld an early macintosh team member although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released in he was removed from the project following a dispute with apple s mercurial boss steve jobs in mr raskin left apple entirely the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin s favourite apple though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company after leaving apple mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers he was also an accomplished musician played three instruments and conducted san francisco s chamber opera society mr raskin was diagnosed in december with pancreatic cancer and died on february at his home in california

games enter the classroom video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom with violent titles continuing to top the charts gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom games teach life skills such as decision making problem solving said martin owen at futurelab mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error futurelab is a non profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpool based games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market learning games were somewhat old fashioned and we did n t see anyone else doing what we wanted to do said dr carl gavin managing director of lateral visions the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element the result is racing academy a massively multiplayer car racing game which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well it is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational said mr owen players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs before and after racing teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data work collaboratively and review their own performances this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved thinks mr owen the game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other said ben williamson a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers need for learning outcomes and the children s desire to rise to a challenge games in the classroom need to support the teacher it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge he said professor angela macfarlane based at bristol university has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms use of games in schools has been patchy she found with sim city proving the most popular traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so called edu tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun she found in her research it is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies she wrote in a paper entitled games and learning lite versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles persuading developers to write for the educational market this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing already there are games on the market such as civilisation and age of empire that have educational elements said mr owen even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people he said it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though
gadget growth fuels eco concerns technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi tech products at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month several hi tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel apple and ibm among others to promote recycling the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over in but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the us environmental protection agency epa of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology the consumer electronics association cea has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in will reach more than billion nearly billion ebay s initiative pulls together major technology firms environment groups government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them the online auction house thinks that its already established community of loyal users could be influential we really became aware of the e waste issue and we saw that our million users can be a powerful force for good ebay s david stern told the bbc news website we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment teenagers get a new mobile every months adults every months and a million handsets are replaced in total each year yet only are actually recycled this year a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile according to a deloitte report schemes in the us like ripmobile could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages the initiative which was also launched at ces rewards to year olds for returning unused phones this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games said seth heine from ripmobile one group of students collected mobiles for recycling in just three months mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes learned behaviour europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust end of life programmes although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free there is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free intel s allen wilson told the bbc news website there is still low level awareness right now but it is on the rise the highest level of awareness is in europe a european union eu directive weee waste electronic and electrical equipment comes into effect in august it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances elements like chromium lead and cadmium common in consumer electronics goods will be prohibited in all products in the eu by but it is not just about recycling either the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too the biggest culprit according to the epa is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed energy vampires they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones pdas personal digital assistants digital cameras camcorders and digital music players although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget on january new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct but at ces the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo meaning they are about more efficient the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers adaptors are being brought on board most are made in china about two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the us alone the epa is already working with several companies which make more than of power supplies on the market we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hi tech devices but also bundle with it a hi tech efficient power supply the epa s andrew fanara said initiatives like this are critical if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than of electricity used in us homes said the epa
evil twin fear for wireless net people using wireless high speed net wi fi are being warned about fake hotspots or access points the latest threat nicknamed evil twins pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations say cranfield university experts once logged onto an evil twin sensitive data can be intercepted wi fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability london leads the global wi fi hotspots league with more than the number of hotspots is expected to reach by according to analysts users need to be wary of using their wi fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature said professor brian collins head of information systems at cranfield university users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi fi device has its security measures activated he added bt openzone which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wi fi secure naturally people may have security concerns said chris clark chief executive for bt s wireless broadband but wi fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet like broadband or dial up he said bt openzone as well as others have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot this means that users personal information and data logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure said mr clark in the vast majority of cases base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible said dr nobles cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin cybercriminals do n t have to be that clever to carry out such an attack said dr phil nobles a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency although wi fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high speed net on the move there have been fears over how secure it is some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company s computer system public wi fi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud are accessible after users sign up and pay for use but many home and company wi fi networks are left unprotected and can be sniffed out and hi jacked by anyone with the correct equipment bt advises that customers should change all default settings make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly said mr clark we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museum s dana centre in london on thursday
china to overtake us net use the chinese net using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years says a report china s net users number m but this represents less than of the country s billion people market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the million us users of the net by the report says that the country s culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations said william makower chief executive of panlogic in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare this combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china only of chinese homes have telephones according to reports net usage tends to happen in the evening said mr makower they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf its fundamentally different usage to what we have here he said net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country s eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends said mr makower many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life for instance said mr makower credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt the most popular way to pay is cash on delivery he said and that s quite a brake to the development of e commerce the arrival of foreign banks in china due in could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare said mr makower but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar he said generally it s more difficult for the government to be able to control it its real value is as an open window onto what s happening elsewhere in the world he said government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet it s a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it said mr makower

google launches tv search service the net search giant google has launched a search service that lets people look for tv programmes the service google video beta searches closed caption information that comes with programmes it only searches us channel content currently results list programmes with still images and text from the point where the search phrase was spoken it should expand over time to include content from more channels said a google spokesperson the first version of the service is part of google s expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond we think tv is a big part of people s lives said jonathan rosenberg google s vice president of product management ultimately we would like to have all tv programming indexed google video has been indexing us based programmes from pbs the nba fox news and c span since december but there were few clues from google about when more global broadcasters would be included over time we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via google video but do n t have more product details to share with you today a google spokesperson told the bbc news website the results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel date and time it also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a us zip code search function rival search engine yahoo has been developing a similar type of video search for webcasts and tv clips which it promotes from its homepage it offers direct links to websites with movies or other clips relevant to the search query but does not pinpoint when the search query occurred a spokeswoman told the financial times on monday that yahoo was adding captioning for bloomberg bbc and bskyb broadcasts a smaller service blinkx tv was launched last month it searches for and links to tv news film trailers and other video and audio clips
rich pickings for hi tech thieves viruses trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash steal valuable data or take over home pcs viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to said pete simpson head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e mail message attachments it s about outright criminality now said mr simpson explaining why this change has come about he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order former virus writer marek strihavka aka benny from the a virus writing group recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers phishing gangs and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors not least said paul king principal security consultant at cisco because the defences against such attacks are so common in many ways the least likely way to do it is e mail because most of us have got anti virus and firewalls now he said few of the malicious programs written by hi tech thieves are cleverly written many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data if you think of criminals they do not do clever said mr king they just do what works as the tactics used by malicious programs change said mr king so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded as well as using different tactics criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent the main motivation now is money said gary stowell spokesman for st bernard software mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high with almost any phishing or spyware attack criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover so called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine
blog reading explodes in america americans are becoming avid blog readers with million getting hooked in according to new research the survey conducted by the pew internet and american life project showed that blog readership has shot up by in the last year some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the us presidential campaign despite the explosive growth more than of online americans have still never heard of blogs the survey found blogs or web logs are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts opinions or spread news events in their own words companies such as google and microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs the rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information with six million americans now using rss aggregators rss aggregators are downloaded to pcs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs news sites and other websites the aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them the survey found only of the million us adults who use the internet had created a blog or web based diary getting involved is becoming more popular though with saying they had posted material or comments on other people s blogs just under one in of the us s internet users read political blogs such as the daily kos or instapundit during the us presidential campaign kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than bush voters blog creators were likely to be young well educated net savvy males with good incomes and college educations the survey found this was also true of the average blog reader although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities the survey was conducted during november and involved telephone surveys of internet users
software watching while you work software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a pc but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong doing has been unveiled worries about cyber crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees the developers behind the system claim it is a break through in the way data is monitored and stored but privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software the system is a joint venture between security firm ami and storage specialists bridgehead software they have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hi tech crime unit nhtcu a survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber crime bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove to a legal standard that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the freedom of information act which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time the storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party copied printed deleted or saved to cd floppy disk memory stick or flash card other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data such as governments are using biometric log ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee s privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff that is not the case said tim ellsmore managing director of ami it is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof he said people need to recognise that you are using a pc as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data he added
new delay hits eu software laws a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer based inventions the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open source software innovation there was at one point the intention to put the item on today s agenda but in the end we could not put it on an eu spokesman told the reuters agency he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law in december poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting poland is a large eu member so its backing for the legislation is vital the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters in the us the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its one click shopping service critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing
savvy searchers fail to spot ads internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits the report by the us pew research center reveals that of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid for results and organic ones the report reveals that of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online almost of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about minutes per month carrying out separate searches and looks at webpages for each hunt a significant chunk of net users carry out a search at least weekly and of those asked only look every few weeks for of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it according to pew research of searchers use just a single search engine use two or three and a small number consult more than three sites tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes a small number said they would n t really miss search engines if they did not exist the remaining said they could not live without search sites more than two thirds of those questioned said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web of those asked were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search only of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not said the pew report this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference
games firms face tough future uk video game firms face a testing time as they prepare for the next round of games consoles the industry warns fred hasson head of tiga which represents independent developers said that more uk firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles three leading uk video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt microsoft sony and nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next months microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that xbox will be released in the us before the end of the new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games mr hasson said in the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers he said there were about independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities he said mr hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines that figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the bbc news website codemasters climax and rebellion as consoles get more powerful the content gets more detailed and that means more cost said gary dunn development director at codemasters which develops games in house and also publishes titles jason kingsley chief executive of rebellion said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger he added we have been through five technology transitions and survived so far each one has involved the death of some people all companies said they were investing in new tools called middleware in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control simon gardner president of climax s action studio said we are investing in superior tools and editors we are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams it s vital we avoid huge teams he said climax was already directing about of its resources to preparation for next generation titles mr dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming development and artistic talent if companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams at some point the talent is going to run out mr hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more business like there are still some developers who were involved in games from the bedroom coding days some of them are still making games for peer group approval that has to stop
microsoft makes anti piracy move microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features the windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates but their options would be limited microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft s site those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and add ons that the software giant offers people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number microsoft s regular patches which it releases for newly found security flaws are important because they stop worms viruses and other threats penetrating pcs some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats with more pcs left unprotected but graham cluley senior consultant at security firm sophos told the bbc news website that it was a positive decision it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net he said windows genuine advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in september for english language versions of windows microsoft s windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time software piracy has cost the company billions it says the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware which of pcs are infected with the virus fighting program updated monthly is a precursor to microsoft s dedicated anti virus software last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project a uk based pilot scheme which ran from november to december the scheme meant that anyone with pre installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china norway and the czech republic where pirated software is a huge problem by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows china in particular is a problem with piracy estimated at said mr cluley

smart search lets art fans browse if you do n t know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting artgarden developed by bt s research unit is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection it chooses a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them so for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement th century and water a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tate s digital programme for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i did n t have a clue what i wanted he said the text based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead he thinks the dominance of text based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object you do n t arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they would n t have asked for he said the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films
warning over windows word files writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business according to document security firm workshare up to of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed a survey by the firm revealed to make matters worse of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers said andrew pearson european boss of workshare which commissioned the research the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too he said the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes as documents get passed around worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits microsoft however does provide an add on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem the remove hidden data add in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application says the instructions on microsoft s website microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document a tool for apple machines running word is not available workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that on average of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three quarters fell in to the high risk category often said mr pearson this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared however the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if for instance those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated the research revealed that a document s metadata could be substantial as on average only of contributors changes to a document make it to the final draft problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite said mr pearson
net regulation still possible the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tv quality video online becomes a norm at a debate in westminster the net industry considered the options lord currie chairman of super regulator ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option at the debate organised by the internet service providers association ispa lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self regulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb itv and the bbc head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms how risque can i be in this new age with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely i can push it to the limit he said in fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high profile legal cases richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible huge changes are afoot in he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net the bbc s planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said mr ayers as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign if content is on demand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it there is no watershed on the net said mr burke

latest opera browser gets vocal net browser opera due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud the voice features based on ibm technology are currently only available in the windows version opera can also magnify text by up to times and users can create style sheets its developers say this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone said opera spokeswoman berit hanson so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people our idea was to take a first step in making human computer interaction more natural said ms hanson people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard so this makes the web a more hands free experience unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice around voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone the voice recognition function is currently only available in english opera is free to download but a paid for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support opera began life as a research project a spin off from norwegian telecoms company telenor its browser is used by an estimated million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms
web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish language music but what you will not find is much spanish language hip hop hip hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish speaking world but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad but now a us company is bringing rap and hip hop en espanol to computer users everywhere los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico s hottest hip hop acts they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey but most mexican hip hop fans not to mention fans in most of the spanish speaking world rarely get a chance to hear the group s tracks on the radio you ca n t really just go on the radio and listen to hip hop in spanish it s just not accessible says manuel millan a native of san diego california it s really hard for the spanish hip hop scene to get into mainstream radio you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world millan and two friends set out to change that they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible so millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio com the name says it all it is web based radio devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip hop tracks the site which is in both in english and spanish is meant to be easy to navigate all the user has to do is download a media player there are no djs it is just music streamed over the net for free suddenly with the help of the website los caballeros de plan g are producing export quality rap the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip hop right now the genre is in what millan calls its infant stage but the production values are improving and artists such as argentina s mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio com he s considered the eminem of argentina and the latin american hip hop scene millan says he really has n t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world but he s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish speaking world currently the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio com s top as is cuban artist papo record every country s got it s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs millan says latinohiphopradio com has been up and running for a couple of months now the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world right now mexico leads the way accounting for about of listeners but web surfers in spain are logging in as well about of the web station s traffic comes from there that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish language rap and hip hop millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip hop production that might be changing though as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio com s top his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip hop leader in spain on his track uno contra veinte emcees or one against emcees tote king shows he is well aware of that fact it s basically him bragging that he s one of the best emcees in spain right now millan says and it s pretty much true he has the tightest productions and his rap flow is impeccable it s amazing latinohiphopradio com is hoping to expand in the coming year millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip hop and rap clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production

norway upholds napster ruling a norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable mp files has been ordered to pay compensation by the country s supreme court frank allan bruvik was ordered to pay kroner to the music industry in norway he was a student when he set up his napster no site which allowed users to submit and receive links to mp files bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry music industry bosses in norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium frank allan bruvik set up the napster no website as part of a school project in while studying computer engineering in the norwegian town of lillehammer the website was not associated with the napster com site in the usa which had been operating since and was already facing legal action bruvik s site was online between august and november and while it did not host any music at its peak it was providing links to more than free files on other servers as well as providing links the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors a legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including norway s performing rights society tono and the norwegian branches of sony music and universal music who saw it as an important test of principle a norwegian court ruled in that bruvik would have to pay kroner to the music industry but the country s court of appeal cleared him saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music however the supreme court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law it added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act and that bruvik s actions were premeditated norway s music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling because showed that music piracy would not be accepted meanwhile in the usa a further lawsuits against people alleged to have traded copyrighted songs were filed this week by the recording industry association of america the suits brought on behalf of the major record companies cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peer to peer services such as kazaa and edonkey as with preceding cases the fresh action was made against so called john doe defendants who are identified only by the codes given to their computers internet connections
the future in your pocket if you are a geek or gadget fan the next months look like they are going to be a lot of fun the relentless pace of development in the hi tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors particularly among mobile phone firms all suggests that is going to be a very good year to begin with will be the year that third generation g mobile phones become inescapable the network launched in vodafone launched its consumer service in november orange followed in early december and t mobile and o are due to launch in the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up already the extra capacity in g networks lets offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them and i ll write their obituary said niel ransom chief technology officer at alcatel instead operators are likely to push all other things that g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi megapixel devices go on sale but g will not have everything its own way it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to megabits per second and works over distances of up to miles kent is likely to be the site of the uk s first wimax network which is due to go live in and it could be the way that rural areas get high speed net access analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from g and will be a clear winner bob larribeau principal analyst at telecom view said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of g networks and the growing ubiquity of wi fi must not be forgotten either the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in too for a start bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next months the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip voip voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network anyone with a broadband connection which is now more than of the uk s net using population can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared to be the area code for voip calls and is likely to see a lot more consumer focused voip call services starting up home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition if has been the year of the portable music player they looks like it will be the year of the portable media player motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had convergence could mean that single function devices start to dwindle in number instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with
what high definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high definition high definition gives incredible d like pictures and surround sound the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out but when high definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high definition future is an exciting prospect he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and i find it very exciting high definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in months time mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd high definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen high definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too on the whole producing films for high definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about gigabits per second says mr dean our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied about so if you have anything that allows more space you do n t have to compress so hard studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high capacity dvds currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean although the step of down converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day s work says mr dean one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took human hours alone if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high definition dvd but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean high definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very sun tanned but that was make up in the hd version of episode i all these make up lines showed up explains mr dean the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too there are scans of a corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just did n t see it what high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving a dvd like experience from the set top box to the hard drive says mr dean but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves

strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie in increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use d graphics the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short range radio technology with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing too fast too furious digital bridges as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games because i m rubbish at them no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit winning gives you cash for upgrades graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play fatal force macrospace a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth graphics are a bit cartoon like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring both background music and sounds effects work well the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while with the right power up you can go into a matrix style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps

mobiles rack up years of use mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their th anniversary this weekend britain s first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on january by veteran comedian ernie wise in the years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline the first ever call over a portable phone was made in in new york but it took years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherine s dock to vodafone s head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on january cellnet now o launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about and had a battery life of little more than minutes despite that they were hugely popular in the mid s he said they became a yuppy must have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only months to get the second million it s very easy to forget that in when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until when oneone now t mobile was launched orange had its uk launch in both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular
blogs take on the mainstream web logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow these online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye witness account of events most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics the most well known examples include iraqi salam pax s accounts of the us led war former iranian vice president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic s government and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign there are already websites pulling together these first hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinews com launched last november the blogging movement has been building up for many years andrew nachison director of the media center a us based think tank that studies media technology and society highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before he says and blogs were a key part of that transformation among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying we are sorry for george w bush s victory and the responses from his supporters mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers tv and radio we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas he told the bbc news website but they followed the story they did n t lead it some parts of the so called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs others like the french newspaper le monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content i do n t think the mission and role of journalism is threatened it is in transition as society itself is in transition says mr nachison however he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper the one to many road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse says mr nachison the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what s acceptable for public consumption and what is n t that s gone forever with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the so called blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels tools such as google s blogger movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog us research think tank pew internet american life says a blog is created every seconds although less than of the total are updated at least once every two months but experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other said mr nachison and there s going to be bad that comes with the good

bush website blocked outside us surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re election site of president george w bush the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp the international exclusion zone around georgewbush com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites netcraft said that since the early hours of october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney failed by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis on october the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors mike prettejohn president of netcraft speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run up to the election on november he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign however simply blocking non us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites
blogger grounded by her airline a us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog or online diary queen of the sky otherwise known as ellen simonetti evolved into an anonymous semi fictional account of life in the sky but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of inappropriate images delta airlines declined to comment i was really shocked i had no warning ms simonetti told bbc news online i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog i thought if they had a problem someone would have said something before taking action the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest employment law and free speech on personal websites ms simonetti was suspended on september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother s death she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for and created fictional names for cities and companies the airline s name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right according to ms simonetti the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother we often take pictures on flight or on layovers i just though why not include them on my blog for fun i never meant it as something to harm my company and do n t understand how they think it did harm them ms simonetti said she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web of the or so images on the site only one showed ms simonetti s flight wings they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up she said the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended as far as ms simonetti knows there is no company anti blogging policy there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear jeffrey matsuura director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers he said it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly was reasonable and enforced fairly in company policy you have to remember that as an employee you do n t have total free speech anymore he said mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them but they may not be particularly clear when they employees do cross the line he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line he said ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken if they had asked me just take down the blog i would have done it but that was not been given to me as an option she said this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it if i had known it would cost me my job i would not have done that

games deserve a place in class computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom say researchers academics from the institute of education at london university found that games literacy was a key skill for youngsters as well as being used in different areas of the curriculum games are a legitimate area of study in their own right researchers say pupils should also be able to create their own games they say like all games computer and video games entertain while promoting social development and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people s lives said project manager caroline pelletier games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation just like writing or drawing she said the researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male dominated world of game playing without first hand experience of how much fun a game can be they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity said research fellow diane carr the second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them sixth form teacher barney oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film tv and popular music at the a level course he runs at long road sixth form college in cambridge for parents the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment could cause controversy dr andrew burn associate director of the institute of education s centre for the study of children youth and media moved to reassure anxious parents games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film television and literature do he said but we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games the games industry welcomed the report saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children at a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently said roger bennett director general of the entertainment and leisure software publishers association this report is further evidence if it were needed about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming they have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career the three year research project which is being presented at a seminar on tuesday in london was partly funded by the department of trade and industry
nuclear body seeks new tech the computer systems used to monitor the world s nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors a spokesman for the international atomic energy agency iaea said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than years old such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide the agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate secure online access to information said project manager livio costantini iaea inspectors make around visits a year to more than nuclear facilities worldwide they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants to carry out environmental checks and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits for instance was built in the s and largely paper based an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in november aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data design blueprints of nuclear facilities even satellite images of the plant where possible it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries according to a spokesman computer specialist at the iaea peter smith would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques more familiar to video games players into the inspector s toolkit the commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world he said if we could have that on our laptops we could be walking through the plant seeing on the laptop how the plant should look and if there s a door in the wall that is not on our laptop then we have a problem the iaea estimates the total cost of the four year project to upgrade its technology will be m so far it has only received m from the us and the uk failure to replace the hardware and software and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks said an agency statement

pompeii gets digital make over the old fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer generated images that bring the site to life a european union funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer augmented versions of archaeological attractions it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism the technology would allow digital people and other computer generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site the lifeplus project is part of the eu s information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting user friendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage engineers and researchers working in the europe wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented reality system it would require the visitor to wear a head mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor s viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements at pompeii for example the visitor would not just see the frescos taverns and villas that have been excavated but also people going about their daily life augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming this technology can now be used for much more than just computer games said professor nadia magnenat thalman of the swiss research group miralab we are for the first time able to run this combination of software processes to create walking talking people with believable clothing skin and hair in real time she said unlike virtual reality which delivers an entirely computer generated scene to the viewer the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor s view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements the software capable of doing this has been developed by a uk company d andrew stoddart chief scientist at d said that the eu project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life the popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life he said

progress on new internet domains by early the net could have two new domain names the post and travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net s administrative body the names are just two of a total of proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann the other proposed names include a domain for pornography asia mobile phones an anti spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture the post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co ordinate the e commerce efforts of national post offices the travel domain would be used by hotels travel firms airlines tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online it is backed by a new york based trade group called the travel partnership icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted despite this initial approval icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a xxx domain for pornographic websites a similar proposal has been made many times in the past but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it in icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success three of the new so called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as museum and aero others such as info and biz were intended to be more generic in total there are in excess of domain names and the majority of these are for nations but domains that end in the com suffix are by far the most numerous

robots learn robotiquette rules robots are learning lessons on robotiquette how to behave socially so they can mix better with humans by playing games like pass the parcel a university of hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations the study s findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in human robot interaction the work is part of the european cogniron robotics project and was on show at london s science museum we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists said professor kerstin dautenhahn project leader at hertfordshire our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans the research also focuses on human perception of robots including how they should look and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator without such studies you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds professor dautenhahn told bbc news online and i want robots to treat humans as human beings and not like other robots she added in most situations a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person but also with groups of people to find out how they would react the hertfordshire cogniron team taught one robot to play pass the parcel with children showing off its skills at the science museum the unnamed robot had to select approach and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye it even used speech to give instructions and play music however according to researchers it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the robotiquette for human interaction if you think of a robot as a companion for the human being you can think of years into the future concluded professor dautenhahn it might take even longer because it is very very hard to develop such a robot you can hear more on this story on the bbc world service s go digital programme
concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses a security firm has warned the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small for many years the venerable ibm operating system known as os has been the staple software used to power many of the m cash machines in operation around the world but ibm will end support for os in which is forcing banks to look for alternatives there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways todd thiemann spokesman for anti virus firm trend micro said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that of new cash machines being installed were windows based already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them in january the slammer worm knocked out cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce in august of the same year cash machines of two un named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm incidents like this happen said mr thiemann because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system he said banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network mr thiemann told bbc news online but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year currently he said a cash machine has a lifetime of up to years which means that only about of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year windows cash machines have been around for several years he said most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os he said but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment it s pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms he said the many different security systems built in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services apacs which represents the uk s payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal there s no concern that there s going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks he said risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly knit community than in the us where viruses have struck
attack prompts bush site block the official re election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it but keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush com website scott stanzel a spokesman for the bush cheney campaign said the measure was taken for security reasons he declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy the barring of non us visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place in early october a so called denial of service attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs the attack made the site unusable for about five hours about the same time the web team of the bush cheney campaign started using the services of a company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic akamai uses a web based tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis readers of the boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the george w bush domain name ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site the site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site the international exclusion zone around georgewbush com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites netcraft said that since the early hours of october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney have failed by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack mike prettejohn netcraft president speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs and traffic in the run up to the election on november he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign however simply blocking non us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too most american soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the us military s own portion of the net akamai declined to comment saying it could not talk about customer websites

the force is strong in battlefront the warm reception that has greeted star wars battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its back to basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of all out gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise s extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves the sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first person perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player s personal propensity for good or evil there is ample chance to be a wookie shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired up luke skywalker in each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet it really is no more complicated than that locations include the frozen wastes of hoth the ice planet from the empire strikes back complete with massive mechanical at ats on the march there are also the dusty sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis as well as the forest moon of endor where return of the jedi s much maligned ewoks lived the feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic it is worth noting though that on the playstation the game s graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version the pivotal element behind battlefront s success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large scale war the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over speaking of noise battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy s audio motifs the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long the gameplay is reliable bog standard stuff short on originality there are also odd annoyances like the game s insistence on re spawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be that said it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike however non user friendly they prove whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game the above average ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated battlefront s novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty one trick pony of a game but for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas stable

gta sequel is criminally good the grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition the certificate gta san andreas for the playstation could have got away with merely revisiting a best selling formula with a more of the same approach instead it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps carefree over all the drivr and true crime shaped opposition even in the year that will see sequels to halo and half life it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic the basic gameplay remains familiar you control a character on this occasion a youth named cj who sets out on a series of self contained missions within a massive d environment cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push bike to a city bus to a plane all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family to make things worse he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas comprising three major cities los santos which is a thinly disguised los angeles san fierro aka san francisco and las venturas a carbon copy of las vegas san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing its ability to capture the ambience of the real world versions of these cities is something to behold assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city the streets and vast swathes of countryside are by turns gloriously menacing grungy and preppy flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail the game s overall look particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets is stupendous the outstanding bread and butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on cars handle more convincingly than ever a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds and there s more traffic to navigate than before park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway and within seconds there will be a huge pile up pedestrians are also out in force and are a loquacious bunch cj can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility aspects that the player now has control over clothes tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up but will swell up as a result of over eating and at last this is a gta hero who can swim at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young san andreas violence or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence are sure to inflame the pro censorship brigade developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality and in some respects ramp it up from past outings when hijacking a car for example cj will gratuitously shove the driver s head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle indeed the tone is darker than the jokey vice city the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy s setting of the last game this title incidentally is set in but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists the wit is still present just more restrained than in previous outings a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options where gta games trademark humour is anchored the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off the chart the game s rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed it is a testament to san andreas magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws but plus points are so numerous that the niggles do n t detract the on screen map for instance is needlessly fiddly an unwelcome change from past editions there is also a very jarring slowdown at action packed moments and the game suffers from the age old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings san andreas is among the few unmissable games of

when invention turns to innovation it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people s lives substantially but says nick donofrio senior vice president of technology and manufacturing at ibm it was not the thing itself that actually improved people s lives it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the st century we have to think more like this but faster mr donofrio told the bbc news website after giving the royal academy of engineering hinton lecture the invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did these are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology argues mr donofrio industry week s technology leader of the year the hype and over promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life gets better as a result in the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes somebody had a new thing that would awe you you were n t quite sure that it did anything you were n t quite sure if you needed it you were n t quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face it will creep in pervasively nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure says mr donofrio pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there like air people will not have to do anything to stay connected people will know their lives are just better says mr donofrio trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances ultimately there will be says mr donofrio no value in being computer illiterate to some it sounds like a technological world gone mad to mr donofrio it is a vision innovation that will happen behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing says mr donofrio deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing it has value according to ibm because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts commands and requirements of a diverse world as computing and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture walls and clothing physical space becomes a more important consideration this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience i am confident that the set science engineering and technology industry is going to be short on skills he says if i am right about what innovation is you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative women tend to have those traits a lot better than men eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he says in the uk a dti funded resource centre for women has set a target to have representation on set industry boards ibm according to mr donofrio has our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio we believe in the whole issue of global diversity he says our customers are diverse our clients are diverse they expect us to look

text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television the blogging world though might know him better by his online name morquendi he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast cell phone signals were weak land lines were unreliable so mr senanayake started sending out text messages the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on the ground assessment of who needs what and where blogging friends in india took mr senanayake s text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent and that s when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call he says in every rural community there s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone or has a mobile phone and can receive messages half a world away in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago taran rampersad read morquendi s messages mr rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help mr rampersad said imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets and had a central place to send a text message to that effect he can message the server so the server can send out an e mail message and human or machine moderators can e mail aid agencies and get it out in the field he added or send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september last week he sent out e mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia in only hours he found dan lane a text message guru living in britain the pair along with a group of dedicated techies are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache the idea is to use open source software software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint and a far flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people says paul saffo a director at the california based institute for the future you may be halfway around the world from someone but in cyberspace you re just one click or one e mail away he said that s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they re not right on top of the tragedy it is still very early days for the project though in an e mail dan lane calls it an early proof of concept right now the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web page or distribute it to an e mail list in the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages but there s still another challenge you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use it s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what we re trying to do and everything like that says mr rampersad so the big problem right now is the same problem we re trying to solve human communication he is optimistic however he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments too will sit up and take notice and he stands by his motto courtesy of michelangelo criticise by creating clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production
putting a face to big brother literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi tech gadgets imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour and perhaps even alert you to new e mails basic versions of these so called avatars already exist together with speech and voice recognition systems they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future some of these ideas have been showcased at the london s science museum as part of its future face exhibition one such avatar is jeremiah it is a virtual man which you can download for free and install in your computer his creator richard bowden lecturer at the centre for vision speech and signal processing at the university of surrey refers to jeremiah as him rather than it jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity he is very childlike he likes visual stimulus he told the bbc news website when he sees children running and laughing and waving at him he smiles at them if you ignore him he gets angry if you leave he gets sad and you can also even surprise him jeremiah is not actually intelligent it works on vision reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system it is not able to talk or to hear you at least not yet the surrey team is already working on jeremiah s next version that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature finn the fish i am interested in the interaction providing the ability of a system to watch what s going on and make decisions based on that explained dr bowden the research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi tech gadgets experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices such as a virtual human could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos if you get up at three o clock in the morning and you go downstairs there are probably two things you are going to do either going to the bathroom or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea said dr bowden now if the system can watch your behaviour over time it can learn this so it would predict what you are going to do turn on the lights for you or before you even get to the kettle it could have switched it on you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left this might sound like a scary vision of an orwellian future but it might all depend on the face that is watching you when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them said dr bowden but when jeremiah s camera went in nobody minded because although it s still watching them they could see what it was watching
football manager scores big time for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager cm indeed it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs however last year was the final time that developers sports interactive si and publishers eidos would work together they decided to go their separate ways and each kept a piece of the franchise si kept the game s code and database and eidos retained rights to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game so at the beginning of this year fans faced a new situation eidos announced the next cm game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst si developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers sega under the name football manager so what does this mean well football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series and it has been released earlier than expected at this point cm looks like it will ship early next year but given that football manager is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape up a game like fm could blind you with statistics it has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans but that does not do justice to the game really what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance england and scotland that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south of course you might be looking for european glory or to get hold of abramovich s millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan the list goes on a very long way once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you sometimes it is promotion or a place in europe sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle it might even be a case of champions or else obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having a look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it then bring on the matches which are once more available in the ever improving top down d view with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed however there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well things like the manager mind games which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses the match engine is also much improved and it is more of a joy than ever to watch in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience with a game that is so complex and so open ended there are of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area and a sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybody s satisfaction but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay and if there are problems further down the line sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible in all there are many more tweaks and improvements if you were a fan of the previous cm games then fm might make you forget there was anything else before it if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership spurs into europe or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree fm could be the best purchase you ever made just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas football manager out now for the pc and the mac
musicians upbeat about the net musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music a survey has found the study by us researchers pew internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file sharing while most considered file sharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders even successful artists do n t think the lawsuits will benefit musicians said report author mary madden for part of the study pew internet conducted an online survey of musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april they ranged from full time successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music we looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry ms madden told the bbc news website we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web more than offered free samples online while two thirds sold their music via the net independent musicians in particular saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically said ms madden they are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright perhaps surprisingly opinions about online file sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry through the recording industry association of america riaa it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us it found that most artists saw file sharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing said one musician quoted by the report it s hard to keep making records if they do n t pay for themselves through sales however said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters many suggested that rather than fighting file sharing the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy said ms madden

ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in with a number of high profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks far from looking like a mould breaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a s handheld prototype the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre eminence in an increasingly competitive mobile gaming market nintendo first launched its gameboy console in and has dominated the market ever since but its lead can no longer be taken for granted sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while start up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points it went on sale in the us in mid november priced and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of to get the device with more than two million pre orders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters a d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top down map and the ability to switch weapons it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating super mario ds is a faithful re creation of the nintendo classic with a host of new mini games and new levels the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine one thing is for certain hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks
no half measures with half life could half life possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it s safe to say that this is the most highly anticipated computer game of all time fortunately it does n t merely live up to its promise but exceeds it no one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped all the money or indeed time is on the screen the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original half life having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster infested research facility he s back in another foreboding troublespot the enigmatic city it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city but as soon as your train pulls in to the station it s clear that all is not well here sinister police patrol the unkempt streets and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task it is not immediately explained what your objectives are nor precisely why everything is so ravaged finding out step by step is all part of the experience although you never fully get to understand what it was all about that does not really matter hl does not waste energy blinding you with plot underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective and immerses the player in the most vivid convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen there are no cut scenes to interrupt the flow exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top notch theme park thrill ride wandering through half life s world truly does feel like being part of a movie considering its sophistication the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc s components this is it on our test machine an alienware system with an athlon processor and ati s radeon x video card everything ran at full quality without trouble and the visual experience was simply jaw dropping it is not simply that the surfaces textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them the haunting grim landscapes become strangely beautiful luckily you get time to pause mid task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings so impressive are the physics that you ll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move there are puzzles to be solved along the way pitched at about the right difficulty but most progress is achieved by force freeman is quickly reunited with the original game s famous crowbar and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with and in realistic fashion you will be wowed by the attention to detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls chase a pigeon out of your way or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed at times half life feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome running around on foot is great enough but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles in gameplay terms hl somehow gets almost everything perfect and without resorting to the zombies leaping out of shadows approach of doom iii it s all incredibly unsettling the vacant environment is distinctly eerie and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside the game does have a couple of problems firstly the carefully scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue which makes for exciting moments but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you ve completed it if you like things open ended and free ranging far cry will be a lot more pleasing but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run installing it proved a life draining siege that would test a saint s patience developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy the box does warn you of this anti piracy measure but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed the temperamental valve servers and the time of day but it can take hours it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances but luckily half life is up to the challenge it is surely the best thing in its genre and possibly many will feel of any genre the bar has been raised and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future half life is out now for the pc

file swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down one site behind the success of the bittorrent file swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised that file sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to now the man behind suprnova org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new file swapping network dubbed exeem in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file sharing systems like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone there will be no centrally maintained list this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users an early public version of the software should be available before february sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development there were no plans for a linux or mac version he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program despite suprnova administrator sloncek s involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer to peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file sharing systems but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared exeem cannot prevent pollution he said the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that s full of crap like kazaa he said there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said mr pouwelse said that future versions of file sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic it s hard to compete with free he said no one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file sharing development
online games play with politics after bubbling under for some time online games broke through onto the political arena in the us presidential election provided a showcase for many aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of the iowa game commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean more than followed suit including frontrunner elections president forever and the political machine which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign including having to cope with the media others helped raise the stakes during the bush kerry contest by highlighting a candidate s virtues or his vices the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games a handful of multi discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers when i started researching political games at the university about five years ago i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen said gonzalo frasca computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved added the uruguayan born researcher who has so far created games for two political campaigns many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming com the aim is to comment on international news events via games the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation mr frasca told the bbc news website this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay cambiemos an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country s problems could be solved by working together it s up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games ultimately dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes fears and beliefs children learn a lot about the world through play there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns this is hardly surprising compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web only a few years ago most politicians did not have a webpage while now it is almost a must have dr frasca said political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them it will not replace other forms of political propaganda but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns

who do you think you are the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst bill thompson it is what happens when it arrives at the other end the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society our identities armed with the personal details that a bank holds plus a fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else s name and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish but however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system in fact i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time has anyone checked bob cratchit s family links to the criminal underworld i wonder and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted health authorities government agencies and of course the big e commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files companies like securewave for example can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual s personal memory card these solutions are not perfect but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e commerce and online trading the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the back office it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked in fact i do not know of a single case where an e mail containing payment details has led to card fraud there are simply too many e mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud cd universe powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused any organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it unauthorised disclosure is not allowed but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice this is not something we can just leave it to the market the consequences of having one s identity stolen are too serious and markets respond too slowly after all i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems i doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial

brainwave cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer four people two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with electrodes previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the results show that people can learn to use scalp recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane the research team from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which meant no surgery or implantation was needed brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively the impressive non invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis said the researchers the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried although the two partially paralysed people performed better overall the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain control experiments some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques earlier this year a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character
europe backs digital tv lifestyle how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change following the launch of an ambitious european project in nice last week the european commission announced its networked electronic media nem initiative its broad scope stretches from the way media is created through each of the stages of its distribution to its playback the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly when on the move at home or at work no matter who supplies the devices network content or content protection scheme more than experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia intel philips alcatel france telecom thomson and telefonica it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together but again and again speakers stated they could not see incompatible stand alone solutions working a long term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline pick out the best bring them together and identify where the gaps are where it finds holes it will develop standards to fill them what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget this is bound to please if not surprise many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management drm schemes currently drm solutions are incompatible locking certain types of purchased content making them unplayable on all platforms with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally the prize for being the supplier of the world s dominant drm scheme is huge although entertainment is an obvious first step it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare energy efficiency and control of the smart home the year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website which covers the impact of technology on media
a decade of good website design the web looks very different today than it did years ago back in yahoo had only just launched most websites were text based and amazon google and ebay had yet to appear but says usability guru dr jakob nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today roughly of the things we found years ago are still an issue today he said some have gone away because users have changed and have changed because technology has changed some design crimes such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said dr nielsen but there s great stability on usability concerns he told the bbc news website dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site s total design were as important as ever it s necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such he said they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off he said but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google amazon ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful said dr nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet he said they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user none of them have a fancy or glamorous look he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied in the future dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online they are becoming like the operating system to the internet he said but he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better currently he said search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use terms in only words were used i think it s amazing that we have seen a doubling in a year period of those search terms said dr nielsen you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme go digital
d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past metal slug is a wake up call to today s gamers molly coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings with its hand animated sprites and d side scrolling this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year and yes that includes halo simply choose your grunt and wade through five d side scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter it is also the toughest game you are likely to play as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on players must battle soldiers snowmen zombies giant crabs and aliens not to mention the huge screen filling bosses that guard each of the five levels the shoot anything that moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old school genius fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware tanks jets and submarines can be commandeered as well as cannon toting camels elephants and ostriches more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls and while this is a tough nut to crack it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go and at a mere metal slug is as cheap as sliced fried spuds as the man says of course most of you will ignore this lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation metal slug is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates eye

consumers snub portable video consumers want music rather than movies while on the move says a report produced by jupiter research the analysis of the portable media player market found only of europeans want to watch video while out and about by contrast almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an ipod the firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible the report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of europe s portable player market was likely to be music rather than films or any combination of the two barely of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies only wanted a player that could handle games and video dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in europe today despite their high prices said ian fogg jupiter analyst mr fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual purpose device europeans care most about music playback he said the report showed that of consumers asked are interested in portable music players the research revealed that french and british consumers were most interested in music players mr fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback a separate report by jupiter forecasts that the european digital music market will grow to m euros m by at the end of the market was worth m euros m digital music players will be behind this market growth said jupiter apple s ipod was launched in october but the portable music player market has been growing steadily since the launch of the creative nomad jukebox in mid now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of high capacity portable music players that let them store every track on every cd that they own
learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work i can sit in a caf or a library with or without a wi fi connection and research and write articles if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne a children s writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial up connection on her daughter s laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial up she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively but the impact spread into her personal life too she did not take her children to the cinema during half term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website and she did not know where to go fossil hunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found a book on fossils but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things she may be unusual but i do not think anne is alone according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april and numbers are climbing fast there will certainly be five million by the end of the year dial up users are switching to broadband my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason it is part of the process of adaptation and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient it may not be the brave new world of streaming full screen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now and it is certainly better than slow access or no access just ask anne bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
nintendo ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in with a number of high profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks far from looking like a mould breaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a s handheld prototype the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre eminence in an increasingly competitive mobile gaming market nintendo first launched its gameboy console in and has dominated the market ever since but its lead can no longer be taken for granted sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while start up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points it went on sale in the us in mid november priced and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of to get the device with more than two million pre orders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters a d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top down map and the ability to switch weapons it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating super mario ds is a faithful re creation of the nintendo classic with a host of new mini games and new levels the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine one thing is for certain hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks
china blocks google news site china has been accused of blocking access to google news by the media watchdog reporters without borders the paris based pressure group said the english language news site had been unavailable for the past days it said the aim was to force people to use a chinese edition of the site which according to the watchdog does not include critical reports google told the bbc news website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes china is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world a net police force monitors websites and e mails and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information popular chinese portals such as sina com and sohu com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments and all net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive china is censoring google news to force internet users to use the chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports said the group in a statement by agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government google has let itself be used by beijing it said for its part the search giant said it was looking into the issue it appears that many users in china are having difficulty accessing google news sites in china and we are working to understand and resolve the issue said a google spokesperson google news gathers information from some news sources headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm with no human editorial intervention it offers editions of the service including one tailored for china and one for hong kong google launched a version in simplified chinese in september the site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information but google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within china as this would result in broken links
a question of trust and technology a major government department is without e mail for a week and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened a couple of weeks ago i wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uk s department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way depriving staff of e mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people s benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances senior consultants from eds the computer firm which manage the system and microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done fortunately the back office systems which actually pay people their money were still working so only new claims and updates were affected done properly this is bad enough for those affected but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners i am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows to windows xp went wrong and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network this is certainly unfortunate but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved today s computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems it is the network equivalent of godel s theorem any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck what is really disturbing and cannot be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press it is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio s today programme throughout friday morning so why did not the prime minister s official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before friday why was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problem if there had been an outbreak of legionnaire s disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment while eds and microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too and the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand that means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it it would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege a major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently anything less is a betrayal of public trust bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
screensaver tackles spam websites net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e mail lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data we ve never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do said malte pollmann spokesman for lycos europe in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users he said but now we are going to go one step further we ve found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers by getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity mr pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with he said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day he said about one mp file but he said if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day lycos did not want to use e mail to fight back said mr pollmann that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing he said the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real time blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop to limit the chance of mistakes being made lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs the burden of high bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive said mr pollmann sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver while working the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on december and before now has only been trialled in sweden despite the soft launch mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than times in the last four days there s a huge user demand to not only filter spam day by day but to do something more he said before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive
first look at playstation chip some details of the chip inside sony s playstation have been revealed sony ibm and toshiba have released limited data about the so called cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together the playstation is expected in but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch the three firms have been working on the chip since but before now few details have been released about how it might function in a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in february next year at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco the three firms claim that the cell chip will be up to times more powerful than existing processors when put inside powerful computer servers the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling trillion floating point operations or calculations every second the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media ibm said it would start producing the chip in early at manufacturing plants in the us the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers a working version of the ps is due to be shown off in may but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until as well as being inside the playstation the chip will also be used inside high definition tvs and powerful computers in the future all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network said ken kutaragi chief operating officer of sony current pc architecture is nearing its limits
online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research ippr existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the think tank although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate in its report is online community a policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities adopting an ebay type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection what we are proposing is a civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication like a pre legislation discussion the idea of a civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of e democracy at the oxford internet institute the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist it mentions good practice public initiatives like the bbc s ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues but he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer to peer interaction online at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other s reputation by how they treat other members using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built this could mean a civic commons would work within a non market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly recognised rules e government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues with of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic non market interactions said mr davies there is a role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added the paper is part of the ippr s digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain

swap offer for pirated windows xp computer giant microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones the first time initiative is restricted to the uk and to users with pre installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november until december microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy the company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of windows into legitimate ones the windows xp counterfeit project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free subject to certain conditions until the end of the year it is the first time microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world the company told the bbc news website in june the software giant said that the major security update to windows xp service pack would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system the upgrade closed security loopholes in xp and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code the us company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of windows xp to submit it for testing as soon as possible the procedure consists of a series of computer checks collating documents and filling out a witness statement this is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of windows xp software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders said alex hilton licence compliance manager at microsoft the scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry it is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce the plan would enable microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way which would allow it to take action against software pirates microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the uk programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries
ban hits half life pirates hard about people have been banned from playing the half life game game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally copies of half life had been circulating on file sharing systems soon after it was officially released experts said the success of the half life anti piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version half life was officially released on november but before gamers could get to grips with the long awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online authentication involved setting up an account with valve s gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half life read the statement valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the represented one effect of steam s popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game s ranking in the top ten even so the title debuted at no in the uk charts valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve s anti piracy actions in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half life keys copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game just to catch pirates and cheats were false the company said the hack came from the community as do they all it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half life circulating on file swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys rob fahey editor of online news site gamesindustry biz said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system before now he said it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played but with this valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half life he said if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum said mr fahey other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems it s not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games he said this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam type systems that are used to batter people with adverts unless game firms were careful he said they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play

smartphones suffer skulls attack owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper those downloading the software could find all the icons on their phone swapped for images of skulls when installed the malicious program also locks many of the s functions making it hard to use and harder to repair the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones the file nicknamed skulls is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add ons such as wallpaper games and ringtones for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the phone the skulls program is labelled as a file called extended theme manager zip once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications such as contacts calendar notebook etc with non working versions so the phone becomes almost useless the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it one of which includes ignoring a security warning symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself despite this finnish anti virus lab f secure said it had sporadic reports of owners being caught out by it the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee symbian phones produced by sony ericsson motorola benq arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program
musical future for phones analyst bill thompson has seen the future and it is in his son s hands i bought my son max a g phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real life after using it for a while i am not at all tempted to get rid of my sonyericsson p smart phone that has a relatively large screen even if it does only have slower gprs access to the network i can read my e mail surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen last week someone e mailed me a document that had been compressed into a zip file and i was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me by contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max s g phone simply get in the way and i did not see much value in the paid for services especially the limited web access the videos of entertainment news horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal and i did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image never mind micro tv but then max started playing and i realised i was missing the point entirely it is certainly not a great overall experience but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout the video content itself is compelling the quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website and the image is about the same size max was completely captivated and i was intrigued to discover that i had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution it is easy to be dismissive of small screens and indeed anyone of my generation with failing eyesight and the view that there s never anything worth watching on tv is hardly going to embrace these phones but just as the world wide web was the killer application that drove internet adoption music videos are going to drive g adoption with vodafone now pushing its own g service and already established in the uk video on the phone is clearly going to become a must have for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress this will please the network operators who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired g licences but it goes deeper than that playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the download and play model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp players after all why should i want to carry gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want whenever i want streamed to my phone oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someone s pocket or handbag available for other uses too i have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip to do either audio or video streaming and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip but i have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the developed western countries is fast and reliable enough to do both i stream radio to my computer while i work and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that i can find online but nowhere else i am even playing with internet telephony despite my reservations and i appear on go digital on the world service streamed over the web each week but g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over net based ip services the g services are n t quite there yet and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges vodafone will let you access its services on vodafone live as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites this one for example this will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company s collection of partner sites something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator ofcom but we should not see these new phones simply as cut down network terminals if i want fast access to my e mail i can get a g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network the phone is a lot more and it is as a combination of mini tv personal communications device and music video player that it really works there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices accessing a wide range of services over different networks g phones and ipods can co exist at least for a while but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both an mpg player anyone bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
multi purpose tv aids india two thirds of the world s population billion people live on a year or less you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer but that s not the case many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv and now an indian born computer engineer thinks he s come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might i come from a village says prof reddy i know what the population is like many of them are illiterate and many of them have other concerns there nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a pc word processing and powerpoint he said so it s clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment education telemedicine and access to expert advice prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach after all he asked what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to million less fortunate indians let alone the billions of poor people around the world instead prof reddy decided to think of those million indians as a potential market the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this prof reddy says people do this today with television sets if you go to india and many other countries they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal why because personalized entertainment has become very important this hatched a completely new idea he calls it a pctvt a personal computer television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control on the screen pictures not words designate applications like tv voice mail and video e mail this dependence on graphics video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs times more power and more memory than one for a phd prassana rambathla one of prof reddy s graduate students says that when you re talking illiterate you re talking audio and video and that demands exponentially high bandwidth it ca n t choke at any point in time and it has to withstand anything no matter what you re pressing the major part is making it foolproof very tough so that it never breaks he says the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built in audio and video hardware and software limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh although andhra pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley the answer says prof brewer is wi fi we re looking at the thing you ll see in starbuck s or many other hotspots he says we re doing a lot of work on long distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency when the power goes up and down and the links go up and down and the computers you re connected to just get turned off for no reason prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about a month and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt s other technologies such as video mail for example a farmer could use the pctvt s webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay off the underlying problem he says is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy and improve their health care and what i m postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them if i did n t have it it would be an uphill battle even with the technology it s an uphill battle but i have a tool there is hope i can reach them in ways that have not been possible before clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production
computer grid to help the world your computer can now help solve the world s most difficult health and social problems launched this week the world community grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems the donated processor cycles will help the wcg create virtual supercomputers via the net the idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop pcs one of the most successful collaboration projects was seti home run by the search for extra terrestrial life project which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication anyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the wgc website once installed the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process and reports back after completing that task the first wcg problem being tackled will be the human proteome folding project which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold the subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences and technology the body will evaluate proposals from leading research public and not for profit organizations and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year organisations also represented on the board include the united nations development programme and the world health organisation the world community grid will enable researchers around the globe to gather and analyze unprecedented quantities of data to help address important global issues said elain gallin program director for medical research at the doris duke charitable foundation it will inspire us to look beyond the technological limitations that have historically restricted us from addressing some of our most intractable problems she added ibm has donated the hardware software technical services and expertise to build the basic infrastructure for the grid the computer company working with united devices previously developed the smallpox research grid which linked together more than two million volunteers from countries to speed the analysis of some million drug molecules in the search for a treatment for smallpox
how to make a gigapixel picture the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands the finished image is billion pixels in size making it about times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras the huge image of delft was created by stitching together single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot if printed out in standard dots per inch resolution the picture would be m high and m long the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail the website is already proving popular and currently has more than visitors every day the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november that image portrayed bryce canyon national park in utah and was made up of separate photographs the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons image he did it all by hand which was an enormous effort and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques it would be feasible to build a larger image said jurgen den hartog one of the tno researchers behind the project we were not competing with mr lyons but it started as a lunchtime bet the dutch team used already available technologies although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high resolution image we had to rewrite almost all the tools me den hartog told the bbc news website all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image so we had to develop one ourselves the component pictures were taken on july by a computer controlled camera with a mm lens each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days following the success of this project and with promises of help from others the tno team is considering creating a full degree panoramic view of another dutch city with even higher resolution
remote control rifle range debuts soon you could go hunting via the net a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote controlled rifle to shoot down deer antelope and wild pigs for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a hectare texas ranch the live shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet john underwood the man behind the live shot website said the idea for the remote control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site we were looking at a beautiful white tail buck and my friend said if you just had a gun for that a little light bulb went off in my head mr underwood told the reuters news agency a year s work and has resulted in a remote controlled rig on which sits a camera and calibre rifle mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig each remote hunting session will cost with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work species that can be shot will include barbary corsican and mouflon sheep blackbuck antelope and wild pigs already the live shot site lets people shoot rounds at paper and silhouette targets for for each minute shooting session for further fees users can get the target they shot and a dvd recording of their session handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off range or at something it should not be mr underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to texas in a statement the rspca said it had grave concerns about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle we assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a clean kill something the rspca accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport it said animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily said the statement mike berger wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting he said state laws on hunting only covered regulated animals such as native deer and bird species as such there was nothing to stop mr underwood letting people hunt unregulated imported animals and wild pigs mr underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals

uk broadband gets speed injection broadband s rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch an eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider uk online it is times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video on demand and broadband tv the service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use bt s exchanges and will initially only be available in towns it represents a big leap forward for broadband said chris stening uk online general manager the service comes with a hefty monthly price tag but will mean users can download mps in seconds and offers tv quality video streaming the service includes wifi as standard meaning users can connect multiple pcs laptops and game consoles from any room in the house not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas the service will initially be available to users within km radius of telephone exchanges in areas such as london birmingham glasgow and cambridge that represents about million households the service is possible due to a decision to loosen bt s strangle hold on telephone exchanges the process known as local loop unbundling was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs uk online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls video on demand and tv by if the service proves popular the service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the uk and times faster than most broadband services said mr stening it takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it he said countries such as south korea and france have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband in south korea video on demand over the net is cheaper than renting a dvd and online gaming is huge mr stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments a typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a kilobit service this will basically give them megabits each he said
row brewing over peer to peer ads music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience the debate over the legitimacy of file sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser s dream come true and a branding nightmare paul myers chief executive of wippit a peer to peer service which provides paid for music downloads believes it is time advertisers stopped providing oxygen for companies that support illegal downloading you may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service edonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include nat west vodafone o first direct ntl and renault he said in an open letter to the british phonographic industry last month he urged people to follow his lead and dump brands associated with companies such as edonkey the bpi is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks networks like edonkey kazaa and grokster facilitate illegal filesharing the bpi strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue it said in a statement illegal file sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services we are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses it said but the issue is often more complicated for advertisers said mark mulligan a music analyst with jupiter research this has been a problem for a long time ever since the days of napster he told the bbc news website the reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience he said if you put the legality issues aside not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience he added meanwhile companies contacted by the bbc news website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing onetel adverts were spotted on edonkey this week and its response was typical we have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge it is not our policy to advertise through peer to peer networks read a statement from the discount phone firm it has requested the advert be removed immediately said a spokeswoman similarly telecommunications firm ntl blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites since the matter was brought to its attention last month the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites a spokesman told the bbc news website however mr mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations while smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends this is no excuse for well known brands he said i would be surprised if these brands did n t have the know how to prevent this happening he said at the moment edonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well known faces advert on its network many big brands have leveraged the opportunity including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world senator john kerry and president george w bush said chief executive sam yagan there are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network he thinks peer to peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they re most comfortable at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media he said

toxic web links help virus spread virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code those clicking on the poisoned links in e mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti virus software that combs through code contained in e mail attachments the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on november they exploit a windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier like many other recent viruses bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for e mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e mail messages to potential victims but unlike many other recent viruses does not itself travel via mail instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that when clicked on connect back to the machine that distributed that e mail essentially bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a paypal transaction copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread finnish anti virus firm f secure said that so far it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation tim warner spokesman for anti virus firm finjan said you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code most firms have secured their e mail gateway said mr warner but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims the bofra family of viruses which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug can infect machines running windows me nt xp and server users running windows xp that have applied the sp update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits
millions to miss out on the net by of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home says a study around million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information predicts the report by telecoms giant bt it compares to million or of the uk who are not currently online the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is wishful thinking the report concludes the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more the report suggests as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access it predicts the gap between have nets and have nots has been much talked about but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark the report suggests internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it said adrian hosford director of corporate responsibility at bt costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological there is a hard rump of have nots who are not engaging with the net they do n t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits said mr hosford as now the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families the older generation and the disabled those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have nots the disabled will make up and the elderly nearly a third by the report forecasts organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem said mr hosford the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs explained mr hosford such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome he said if we do n t address this problem now it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society he said the alliance for digital inclusion an independent body with members drawn from government industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks

search sites get closer to users search sites want to get to know you better not content with providing access to the millions of websites many now offer ways that do a better job of remembering cataloguing and managing all the information you come across some of the latest to update their search systems are ask jeeves and blinkx which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web the future is all about developing your own personal web said tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves mr macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it because there was no memory of what they had searched for before each time you go back in you have to start all over again he said the series of updates to its service collected under the my ask jeeves banner would help people remember where they had been before ask jeeves has added the ability to save websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved mr macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists cannot be easily searched on average said mr macklin users conduct between five and searches per day and the tools in my ask jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily under my ask jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting it s about finding again what you found before he said the my ask jeeves service lets people store up to a web links or if they sign up to the free service by way of comparison google s desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited at the same time search start up blinkx has released a second version of its eponymous software blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on be it a document or e mail and suggests websites video clips blogs or documents on a pc that are relevant to it since blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as google copernic enfish x and apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their pc as well as the web the competition has validated the problem we tackle said suranga chandratillake co founder of blinkx in the latest release of blinkx the company has added what it calls smart folders once created the folders act as persistent queries that automatically sweep the web for pages related to their subject and catalogues relevant information documents or incoming e mails on hard drives too what users do with blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems he said they might use google to look up a company or yahoo for travel because they know they are good at that he said the classic thing we have seen recently is people using blinkx to look at the things they have searched on he said the variety of ways to search data was only helping users said mr chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks
anti spam screensaver scrapped a contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped lycos europe s make love not spam campaign began in late november but its tactics proved controversial lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti spam measures and had now achieved this aim the anti spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law through the make love not spam website users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages more than people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that lycos europe offered the company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites but the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming type tactics against the senders of junk mail some net service firms began blocking access to the lycos europe site in protest at the action monitoring firm netcraft found that the anti spam campaign was proving a little too successful according to response time figures gathered by netcraft some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests in a statement from lycos europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme the company denied that this was its fault there is nothing to suggest that make love not spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted it said at the time that netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down they were not in fact part of the make love not spam attack cycle it added the statement issued by lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with spare capacity the idea was simply to slow spammers sites and this was achieved by the campaign the company said many security organisations said users should not participate in the lycos europe campaign the closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism
tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems plasma high definition tvs and digital video recorders moving into the living room the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years time that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes with the us leading the trend programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks through cable satellite telecoms companies and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices one of the most talked about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders dvr and pvr these set top boxes like the us s tivo and the uk s sky system allow people to record store play pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want essentially the technology allows for much more personalised tv they are also being built in to high definition tv sets which are big business in japan and the us but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high definition programming not only can people forward wind through adverts they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules putting together their own a la carte entertainment but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as brand identity and viewer loyalty to channels although the us leads in this technology at the moment it is also a concern that is being raised in europe particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky what happens here today we will see in nine months to a years time in the uk adam hume the bbc broadcast s futurologist told the bbc news website for the likes of the bbc there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters but brand loyalty is important for everyone we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands said tim hanlon from brand communications firm starcom mediavest the reality is that with broadband connections anybody can be the producer of content he added the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice what this means said stacey jolna senior vice president of tv guide tv group is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers it means that networks in us terms or channels could take a leaf out of google s book and be the search engine of the future instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them but it might not suit everyone the panel recognised older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands mr hanlon suggested on the other end you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already everything is possible and available to them said mr hanlon ultimately the consumer will tell the market they want of the new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces many of them are about enhancing the tv watching experience high definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd liquid crystal display tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them instead of being external boxes one such example launched at the show is humax s inch lcd tv with an hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies directtv has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with hours of recording capability instant replay and a search function the set can pause and rewind tv for up to hours and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre show keynote speech a partnership with tivo called tivotogo which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want when they want
cyber criminals step up the pace so called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in say security experts the number of phishing e mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than months in it detected more than million phishing e mail messages other statistics show that in of all e mail was spam and one in messages were infected with a virus in its end of year report messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals in september messagelabs caught only phishing e mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations but by september it was stopping more than two million phishing related e mail messages per month worryingly said the firm phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake but more recent phishing e mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards e mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity said mark sunner chief technology officer at messagelabs in just months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online he said mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed indicating a shift from the random scattergun approach to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses he said although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout viruses and spam remain popular with cyber criminals and vandals one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating to date the company has caught more than million copies of the virus also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation in only of messages were spam but by the end of almost three quarters of messages were junk
gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year s sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in a more bellicose mood than last time this sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence as before you control the super athletic prince from a third person perspective the time travelling plot hinges on the dahaka an all consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast s creation studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to old fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be ever since the series then groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulously animated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill until you reach that point it is a haphazard business all too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before the game s developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off warrior within is a very slick package the game s intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences it is on a par with the jaw dropping opening sequence of onimusha earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anti climax that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game the music is probably the worst aspect a merit free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for

halo heralds traffic explosion the growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms warns network monitoring company sandvine it issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of halo the november traffic explosion has continued into december said sandvine service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth as well as being a popular single player title halo can be connected to microsoft s subscription based broadband network xbox live gamers who want to play online can create their own clan or team and take on others to see how well they compare but the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic said sandvine s chief technology officer marc morin in a bid to cope and ease congestion providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent finding out who is using bandwidth and for what it could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use the explosion in xbox live traffic attributed to halo should be seen as a clarion call he said isps need to enhance the broadband experience for these high end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games he added one of the main factors that spoils online gaming is lag in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest lag analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth hungry gamers said lindsay schroth an analyst with research firm the yankee group in the competitive broadband environment operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live play gaming she said in countries such as korea which has high levels of fast net connections to homes online gaming is hugely popular
media gadgets get moving pocket sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in according to industry experts last year saw the emergence of portable media players such as the windows based creative zen portable media player the samsung yepp the iriver pmc and the archos av series among others but this year they are set to get smarter and more connected to allow people to find more video to watch on them archos launched its latest range of its linux based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday dubbed the pocket media assistant pma it crucially has wi fi capability built in for the first time consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access said henri crohas chief of archos and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people s pockets after the mobile unlike windows based players the archos av series devices have always been able to record from any video source such as tvs as well as playback the content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it and wi fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high speed wireless link archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces primarily for us consumers though it has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company tivo which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows based portable media players or smartphones it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central vh and country music tv on its devices and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices but the ability to record directly from tv vcr and digital cable and satellite boxes which windows based devices do not offer certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too the increased capability of these devices and the content deals that are being done may go some way to persuading people to use them recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music only of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move more seemed interested in spending their cash on music only devices this year we are ready for an explosion of portable media microsoft s mike coleman told the bbc news website we are very bullish about it the fact that i can put photos on here too and share them is super cool to the consumer he added the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too there is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work although microsoft s content distribution deals are for the us market at the moment talks were always on going with european content suppliers to offer similar services various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices particularly via those which are wi fi enabled the possibility is open for non professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work ces which runs from to january showcases more than new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in
satellite mapping aids darfur relief aid workers trying to house feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps the aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks for the rivers and for the villages to more large scale maps useful for very general planning purposes said einar bjorgo from unosat the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium the group uses satellites from nasa the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations from there the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data you have to convert the data into images then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis damage or situation maps said stefan voigt who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations the german aerospace centre this kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but respond gets it done in about hours our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery reading satellite maps so it s our task to transfer the data into information that non technical people can read and understand easily and very very efficiently said mr voigt respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web and on compact disc but the best map is one you can hold in your hands especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce a map is a working document explains herbert hansen of respond s belgian partner keyobs you need to use it you need to write on it correct give feedback and so on so you need paper to write on we print maps we laminate the maps we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map it s completely protected humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond s maps they have come in especially handy during sudan s rainy season when normally dry riverbeds or wadis became flooded these wadis had a very small amount of flooding generally in terms of depth but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit respond s rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on the ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production

robotic pods take on car design a new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyota the company s vision for the single passenger in the st century involves the driver cruising by in a four wheeled leaf like device or strolling along encased in an egg shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet both these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the toyota stand at the expo in aichi japan in march the models are being positioned as so called personal mobility devices which have few limits the open leaf like i unit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year built using environmentally friendly plant based materials the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes the model allows the user to make tight on the spot turns move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music also on display at the show will be the egg shaped i foot this is a two legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick standing at a height of well over seven feet metres the unit can walk along at a speed of about km h mph and navigate staircases into the bargain mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird like legs that bend over backwards they are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university they clearly have eye catching appeal which is in part the name of the game here and are linked to the imac and ipod type niche which apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years new different hi tech image conscious products as always with these concept vehicles it is difficult to see who they would appeal to and what their role would be in the personal transport marketplace the personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities toyota s prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much us military research over the years and japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual s particular mobility needs while toyota s prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility experts though are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance now and certainly in the future are the elderly and infirm people dr gillingwater told the bbc news website you have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups design considerations also exist dr erel avineri of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled for example one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up it looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need this and other human factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered said dr avineri in general introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation this may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle such single person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport the concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions said dr gillingwater what s their range how user friendly will they really be what infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used overall i think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions

mobile multimedia slow to catch on there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of according to analysts gartner more than million handsets were sold between july and september a period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so in fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing figures gathered by continental research shows that of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message mms up from in this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to million getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets also he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to according to continental research of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation only regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people s reluctance to start sending them said mr jain they ask themselves if i m streaming video from one handset to another will it work he said there s a lot of user apprehension about that there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users no one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wap push to get multimedia to their customers but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india the largest mobile firm in the country the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems while not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content as a result of the subscribers to the hutch alive which uses celltick s broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said yaron toren spokesman for celltick until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting through

bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of but also the classic shoot em up that accompanied it and left n owners glued to their consoles for many an hour adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original s massive sense of fun this however is not a sequel nor does it relate to the goldeneye film you are the eponymous renegade spy an agent who deserts to the bond world s extensive ranks of criminal masterminds after being deemed too brutal for mi your new commander in chief is the portly auric goldfinger last seen in but happily running around bent on world domination with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner s similarly titled theme song the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury which enables a degree of x ray vision rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by a plummeting helicopter the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise this title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like a lucky accident the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination admittedly the competition has been tough even in recent weeks with the likes of halo and half life triumphing in virtually every department what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaos as is the trend of late you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos meaning that frustration is often the outcome and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed a minute red dot passes for a crosshair although the collision detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky and you will not always know you have picked them off since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker s allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights no time is risked with a measured build up by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hat fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash but the in game niggles combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought through will make this a disappointment for most diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings the game is weak not completely unplayable then again fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras given james bond s healthy pedigree in past games there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip a commendable idea that just has not worked that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return goldeneye rogue agent is out now

video phone help for deaf people deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language bsl could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people rnid but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people s pockets the rnid is urging telecoms regulator ofcom to reduce the cost of the service from the current per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone and the interpreter then relays the deaf person s conversation using a telephone and translates the other person s response into sign language for many deaf people especially those born deaf bsl is a first and preferred means of communication until now the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator in the past i ve used textphones but they have problems said robert currington who is taking part in the pilot i communicate in bsl my written english is not very good and it takes me longer to think in english and type my message i sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply the rnid says the uk is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call there are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people said rnid technology director guido gybels in the us and australia sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call by failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year and new technology including the video relay service will be discussed with interested parties in the near future but a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider he said mr currington like many of the uk s bsl users will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost effective service available the relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure he said i can show my emotions more easily in bsl in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls

speech takes on search engines a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results called speegle it has the look and feel of a normal search engine with the added feature of being able to read out the results scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments the edinburgh based firm cec has married speech technology with ever popular internet search the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web according to search engine ask jeeves around of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad said speegle founder gordon renton the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people although the royal national institute of the blind rnib is looking at the technology he added but julie howell digital policy manager at the rnib expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people s experience of the web there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be she said blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way she added the site uses a technology dubbed panavox which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial up connections visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known if silent search engine google google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments said mr renton it is not a rip off we are doing something that google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery he said speegle is proving popular with those learning english in countries such as japan and china the site is bombarded by people just listening to the words the repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots said mr renton

napster offers rented music to go music downloading for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services can be a costly business the cost of paying even as little as p per track can add up particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient and ultimately cheaper way of owning music music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle either single tracks or subscriptions services said paul myers chief executive of wippit a uk based music download service while itunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to ipod owners others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service dubbed napster to go in the uk in the next few months the service can be used on players that support microsoft windows latest digital rights management technology known as janus this includes players made by samsung rio and creative currently on offer in beta version in the us the service costs per month for unlimited downloads the technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play this has outraged some digital music lovers especially as napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the pc napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to go service and says it also offers greater value for customers mr myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers we ve been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want format interoperability excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose he said who wants to download a track that wo n t play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an ipod or the latest mobile phone wippit offers a download subscription service for per month or per year it has a catalogue of around songs
broadband soars in if broadband were a jumbo jet then would have seen it taxiing down the runway firing up its engines and preparing for take off but this year has seen it soar in the spring it literally took to the skies as lufthansa and british airways trialled it on flights this perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology rather than how useful sky high broadband would actually be it was flying high and by the autumn five million britons had signed up for high speed net access at home such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million or more than of homes the two key factors in whetting people s appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard k broadband for less than at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached broadband had truly gone mass market a feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take up of dial up broadband for less than was even touted by some firms although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models for those who became broadbanders in there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities the rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access to the tune of million connections worldwide by april prompting research firm point topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever by september the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every seconds broadband was being mentioned on the o clock news and in the tabloids the sun even carried a cartoon joke about it but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines in may bt quietly announced that it was shaving off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges so called local loop unbundling the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes at the moment bt has a stranglehold on more than of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes with cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise like it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to mb megabits per second and the major price fall means that rather than just talk about it companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt s exchanges it may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks fraught bitter and with no end in sight another big piece of news for broadband users in was the extension of bt s reach meaning more than of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived there was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to mbps broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband enabled exchange for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology the news meant they could finally join in broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year the biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing mb and mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on k the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route broadband can seem confusing for consumers with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set up fees it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in but remains a plane worth catching as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride
half of uk s mobiles go online multimedia mobile phones are finally showing signs of taking off with more britons using them to go online figures from industry monitor the mobile data association mda show the number of phones with gprs and mms technology has doubled since last year gprs lets people browse the web access news services mobile music and other applications like mobile chat by the end of the mda predicts that of all mobiles in the uk will be able to access the net via gprs the mda say the figures for the three months up to september are a rapid increase on the figure for the same time the previous year about million people own a mobile in the uk so the figures mean that half of those phones use gprs gprs is often described as g technology generation sitting between g and g technology which is like a fast high quality broadband internet for phones with more services being offered by mobile operators people are finding more reasons to go online via their mobile downloadable ringtones are still proving highly popular but so is mobile chat bandaid was the fastest ever selling ringtone this year according to the mda and chat was given some publicity when prime minister tony blair answered questions through mobile text chat multimedia messaging services also looked brighter with of all mobiles in the uk able to send or receive picture messages this is a rise from last september s figures but a recent report from continental research reflects the continuing battle mobile companies have to actually persuade people to go online and to use mms it said that of uk camera phone users had never sent a multimedia message or mms that was more than in mobile companies are keen for people to use multimedia functions their phones like sending mms and going online as this generates more money for them but critics say that mms is confusing and some mobiles are too difficult to use there have also been some issues over interoperability and being able to send mms form a mobile using one network to a different one
blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console its sharp graphics and novel gameplay with the main character able to pause slow rewind and fast forward time were meant to lure many fans to the new machine but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half way through a level without the required tools to finish thankfully the sequel has fixed many of the original faults this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions pig and feline assuming the role of your created characters the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal as in the original your feline persona can control time but this time the pigs get to control space there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps space bubbles and void traps in order to progress the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr style icons and is quite intuitive annoyingly the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps and so there are a number of combat elements these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair but the game s excellent graphics easily the best looking platform game around sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans blinx is out on xbox now
the year search became personal the odds are that when you fire up your browser you go straight to your favourite search engine rather than type in a web address some may see this as the height of laziness but in an era of information overload search has become a vital tool in navigating the net it is symptomatic of how the way we use the internet is changing and as google has shown there is money in offering a service that people cannot live without there is no shortage of companies vying for the loyalty of web searchers offering a wealth of different services and tools to help you find what you want over the past months giants of the technology world such as microsoft and yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action user experience has contributed to people searching more said yonca brunini of yahoo as people become more familiar with the internet they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries she said the other second thing is broadband ms brunini told the bbc news website this will do to internet what colour has done to tv but search is hardly a new phenomenon it has been around since the early days of the net veteran surfers will remember old timers like hotbot and altavista search was always important said urs holzle google vice president of operations we trumpeted that in it is even truer now as there are more users and more information people did n t realise that search was the future the financials have something to do with it google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts which appear at the top and down the right hand side of a page and are related to the original search these small ads helped google reach revenues of m for the three months to september others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries once you see there is a market microsoft is bound to step to it if microsoft sees search as important then nobody queries it said mr holzle microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search yahoo ask jeeves amazon and a handful of smaller outfits are all seeking to capture eyeballs web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search it reflects how the battlefield has shifted from the net to your pc search is not just about finding your way around the web it is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents images and music on hard drives for all these advances search is still a clumsy tool often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind in order to do a better job search engines are trying to get to know you better doing a better job of remembering cataloguing and managing all the information you come across personalisation is going to be a big area for the future said yahoo s yonca brunini whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner we have to understand you to give you better results that are tailored to you this is perhaps the holy grail of search understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly the problem is that no one yet knows how to get there
ibm frees software patents computer giant ibm says of its software patents will be released into the open development community the move means developers will be able to use the technologies without paying for a licence from the company ibm described the step as a new era in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available the patents include software for a range of practices including text recognition and database management traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite ibm s announcement the company continues to follow this route ibm was granted patents in more than any other firm in the us the new york times reports for each of the past years ibm has been granted more us patents than any other company ibm has received us patents in that period and reportedly has more than current patents in a statement dr john e kelly ibm senior vice president technology and intellectual property said true innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted it s about innovating to benefit customers partners and society our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how ibm will manage intellectual property in the past ibm has supported the non commercial operating system linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine microsoft the company said it wanted to encourage other firms to release patents into what it called a patent commons adam jollans ibm s world wide linux strategy manager said the move was a genuine attempt to encourage innovation we believe that releasing these patents will result in innovation moving more quickly this is about encouraging collaboration and following a model much like academia mr jollans likened the plan for a patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration the internet s impact has been on everyone the benefits are there for everyone to take advantage of stuart cohen chief executive of us firm open source development labs said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents i think other companies will follow suit he said but not everyone was as supportive florian mueller campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the european union dismissed ibm s move as insubstantial it s just diversionary tactics wrote mr mueller who leadsnosoftwarepatents com in a message on the group s website let s put this into perspective we re talking aboutroughly one percent of ibm s worldwide patent portfolio they filethat number of patents in about a month s time he added ibm will continue to hold the patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents the company said it would not place any restrictions on companies groups or individuals who use them in open source projects open source software is developed by programmers who offer the source code the origins of the program for free and allow others to adapt or improve the software end users have the right to modify and redistribute the software as well as the right to package and sell the software other areas covered by the patents released by ibm include storage management simultaneous multiprocessing image processing networking and e commerce
yahoo moves into desktop search internet giant yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e mail and other files on their pcs the firm is following in the footsteps of microsoft google and ask jeeves which have offered similar services search has become a lucrative and hotly contested area of expansion for net firms looking to extend loyalty beyond the web with hard drives providing bigger storage users could need more help to locate important files such as photos the desktop search technology has been licensed from a us based firm x technologies it is designed to work alongside microsoft s outlook and outlook express e mail programs searching e mail effectively is becoming increasingly important especially as the amount of spam increases according to research from message analysts the radicati group up to of businesses critical information is stored in e mail and attachments yahoo s software can also work separately on the desktop searching for music photos and other files users can search under a variety of criteria including file name size date and time it does n t yet incorporate web searching although yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web based and desktop data we are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content said julian smith an analyst with research firm jupiter it is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well he said search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web the new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups concerned about the implications to privacy and not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services alexander linden vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm gartner downloaded the google product but has since removed it it was just not very interesting he said he believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals desktop search is just one of many features people would like but i m suspicious of its usefulness he said more useful would be tools that can combine internet intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching he said
rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular especially with tech savvy criminals many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firms to stop these attacks increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures net firms are realising that it s not just about anti virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres mr king said the only way to properly combat these so called distributed denial of service attacks was with intelligent net based systems many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with megabytes of data over short periods of time bigger attacks sending down megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave however he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites it s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi tech criminal that set off the virus hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e mail said ms capella we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up energis took a similar approach said mr seagrave we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target we have people in places where they should n t be monitoring tech sites he said sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave

souped up wi fi is on the horizon super high speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the uk the government s wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called ultra wideband uwb ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of uwb using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second uwb could also be used to create so called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves the technology works over a range up to metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data at the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas products with uwb chips built in got their first public airing currently use of uwb is only allowed in the uk under a strict licencing scheme we re seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow uwb on a licence exempt basis said a spokesman for ofcom companies have until march to respond in april the ec is due to start its own consultation on europe wide adoption of uwb the cross europe body for radio regulators known as the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations cept is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme early sight of the cept work has caused controversy as some think it over emphasises uwb s potential to interfere with existing users by contrast a preliminary ofcom report found that it would be quite straight forward to deploy uwb without causing problems for those that already use it the ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a mask or set of technical restrictions on uwb using devices we would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area he said despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used cambridge based ubisense has about customers around the world using the short range radio technology said david theriault standards and regulatory liaison for ubisense he said that uwb was driving novel ways to interact with computers it s like having a d mouse all the time he said he said that european decisions on what to do with uwb allied with ieee decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate uwb was used as a sensing technology it is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls

web photo storage market hots up an increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections digital cameras were the hot gadget of christmas and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled bn last year many people s hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular search firms such as google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries photo giants such as kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections lets users edit pictures online and provides print ordering services some services such as kodak s ofoto and snapfish offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online other sites such as pixagogo charge a monthly fee marcus hawkins editor of digital camera magazine said as file sizes of pictures increase storage becomes a problem people are using their hard drives backing up on cd and dvd and now they are using online storage solutions they are a place to store pictures to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos while many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other s work on tuesday google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer s hard drive the tool called picasa automatically detects photos as they are added to a pc whether sent via e mail or transferred from a digital camera the software includes tools for restoring colour and removing red eye as well as sharpening images photos can then be uploaded to sites such as ofoto many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints mr hawkins added the growth area is that you can order your prints online friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too rather than just a place to dump your pictures it s about sharing them the vast majority of pictures remain on a pc s hard drive which is why search tools such as those offered by google become increasingly important but some historians and archivists are concerned that the need for perfect pictures will mean that those poor quality prints which offered a tantilising glimpse of the past may disappear forever it s one thing taking pictures it s another finding them said mr hawkins but this is the same problem that has always existed how many of us have photos in wallets tucked away somewhere

cable offers video on demand cable firms ntl and telewest have both launched video on demand services as the battle between satellite and cable tv heats up movies from sony pictures walt disney touchstone miramax columbia and buena vista will be among those on offer the service is similar to sky plus as users can pause fast forward and rewind content but they cannot store programmes on their set top box yet it could sound the death knell for some tv channels telewest predicts it allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over sky for the first time in many years said telewest chief executive eric tveter video on demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on tv there will be less compromising around the tv schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside said philip snalune director of products at telewest telewest customers in bristol and ntl viewers in glasgow will be the first to test the new service which sees a raft of movies on offer for hour rental during the year the service will be extended to all cable regions films will range in price from or for archived movies to for current releases new releases initially on offer will include first dates kill bill volume gothika and the station agent in addition ntl is offering children s programmes adult content music video and concerts telewest will launch similar services later in the year ntl is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed its pick of the week service will offer a selection of bbc programmes from the previous seven days such as eastenders casualty top gear and antiques roadshow the bbc is trialling a similar service offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their pc for telewest it is the beginning of a m investment in tv on demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder pvr pvr has been a big success for sky because it gives customers control over programmes satellite customers without pvr cannot pause rewind or fast forward their programmes with both services on offer from telewest mr tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial tv but also gain a huge competitive advantage over sky we offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video on demand and pvr he said video rental stores may also have to watch their back video on demand is better than having a video store in your living room and is more convenient he said ntl said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a pvr but for the moment is concentrating on video on demand pvr is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand said a spokesman for the company video on demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set top box or extra remote controls he added adam thomas an analyst at research firm informa media believes the time is ripe for video on demand to flourish while sky will remain the dominant force in uk pay tv for some time to come ntl and telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of vod enthusiasm and if marketed correctly this could help them eat into sky s lead he said
cyber crime booms in the last months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague windows pcs the count of known viruses broke the barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than similarly phishing attempts in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data are recording growth rates of more than and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers called bot nets used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes one of the biggest changes of was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast spreading virus said kevin hogan senior manager in symantec s security response group although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code said mr hogan saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs the financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology he said his comment was echoed by graham cluley senior technology consultant from anti virus firm sophos mr cluley said when the commercial world gets involved things really get nasty virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum in particular phishing attacks which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers boomed during web portal lycos europe reported a increase in the number of phishing e mail messages it was catching the anti phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of or more per month those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e mail messages they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses said mr hogan they are very noisy and they are not technically challenging the opening months of did see the appearance of the netsky bagle and mydoom mass mailers but since then more surreptitious viruses or worms have dominated mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in bot nets that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites in september symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active bot computers rose from to per day thanks to these bot nets spam continued to be a problem in anti spam firms report that in many cases legitimate e mail has shrunk to less than of messages part of the reason that these bot nets have become so prevalent he said was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created in the past many viruses such as netsky have been the work of an individual or group by contrast said mr hogan the code for viruses such as gaobot spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time the result is that now there are more than variations of the spybot worm that s unprecedented said mr hogan what makes it difficult is that they are all co existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in in the past threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild in june the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short range radio technology also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones on the positive side finnish security firm f secure said that was the best ever year for the capture arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally minded hackers in total eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so called a virus writing group were sentenced one high profile arrest was that of german teenager sven jaschen who confessed to be behind the netsky and sasser virus families also shut down were the carderplanet and shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers
dublin hi tech labs to shut down dublin s hi tech research laboratory media labs europe is to shut down the research centre which was started by the irish government and the massachusetts institute of technology was a hotbed for technology concepts since its opening in the centre has developed ideas such as implants for teeth and also aimed to be a digital hub for start ups in the area the centre was supposed to be self funded but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs in a statement media labs europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the irish government nor the prestigious us based massachusetts institute of technology mit was willing to fund it prime minister bertie ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi tech companies in an attempt to regenerate the area about three dozen small firms were attracted to the area but it is thought the effects of the dot com recession damaged the labs long term survival the labs needed about million euros us million a year from corporate sponsors to survive in the end it was too deep and too long a recession said simon jones the labs managing director ian pearson bt s futurologist told the bbc news website that the closure was a real shame bt was just one of the companies that had worked with the labs looking at rfid tag developments and video conferencing there were a lot of very talented creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society i have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost noel dempsey the government s communications minister said mr ahern had been very committed to the project he is i know very disappointed it has come to this at the time it seemed to be the right thing to do he said unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate during its five years innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed in recent months patent applications had been filed by the labs many concepts fed into science engineering and psychology as well as technology but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near term several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different the human connectedness group for example developed the iband a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships this information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands other projects looked at using other human senses like touch to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment or on the body itself one project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game the labs set up in an old guinness brewery housed around people made up of staff researchers students collaborators and part time undergraduate students it is thought more than people will lose their jobs when the labs close on february according to its latest accounts media lab europe said it spent million euros about us million in and raised just million euros us million
games help you learn and play god games in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational says research a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore said mr purushotma there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework but instead of fearing computer games ravi purushotma believes that educationalists particularly language teachers should embrace games one goal would be to break what i believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional he said he believes that the phenomenal ability of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation the hard part of learning any language said mr purushotma were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity he said by contrast said mr purushotma learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning said mr purushotma by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context for instance he said in a version of the sims adapted to teach german if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of a tired sim stumbling then falling asleep would illustrate the meaning if necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players or students understanding one of the drawbacks of the sims said mr purushotma was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation however online versions of the sims in which people have to move in meet the neighbours and get to know the local town could be adapted to help this although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid he believes before now he said educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games but he said using pre prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons i m hoping now to re create a well polished german learning mod for the sequel by this summer he told the bbc news website i m encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with japanese and spanish earlier work with a colleague on using civilisation iii to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society s problems can not always come from making a single change a report on the experiment said students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play using geography and history as tools for their game and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play mr purushotma s ideas were aired in an article for the journal language learning and technology

format wars could confuse users technology firms sony philips matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different and conflicting content control systems experts warned they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device independent of how they originally obtained that content the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music movies and other digital content they have bought called the marlin joint development association the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft confusingly for consumers the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats such as betamax and vhs that consumers have seen in the past said ian fogg personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research the difference is that it is very fragmented he said it s not a two horse race it s a five six seven or even eight horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families although initiatives such as microsoft s plays for sure program could help remove some of the uncertainty he said life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come shelley taylor analyst and author of a report about online music services said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this she said although itunes has been hugely successful apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods she said she said rampant competition between online music services of which there are now according to recent figures could drive more openness and freer file formats it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run she said and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop people want portability she said and with peer to peer they have portability cory doctorow european co ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber rights issues expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying he said he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy instead said mr doctorow drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over consumers the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again the ipod version the auto version the american and uk version the ringtone version and so on
peer to peer nets here to stay peer to peer pp networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts once several high profile legal cases against file sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from pp technology the expert panel probed the future of pp at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january the first convictions for pp piracy were handed out in the us in january william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software since the first successful file sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of pp technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy but that is going to change very soon according to the panel the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate pp networks which are not illegal in themselves and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks but they have slowly realised that pp is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of pp network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy protection standards but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with pp cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media when they ca n t stop it they try to control it then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business in august the san francisco based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file sharing networks the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the s vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal pp networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files instead it uses direct connections between computers or clients there are now many different types of pp systems than work in different ways pp nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use pp technology to distribute them the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many the global entertainment industry says more than billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file sharers away from free content sales of legally downloaded songs grew tenfold in with million tracks bought online in the us and europe in months the ifpi reported this week but such download services are very different from pp networks not least because of the financial aspect there are several money spinning models that could turn pp into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies paid for pass along in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser based options are all being considered we see there are going to be different models for commoditising pp said marc morgenstern vice president of anti piracy firm overpeer consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and pp technology by continuing to use it for their own creations unsigned bands for example use pp networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign increasingly what you are seeing on pp is consumer created content said derek broes from microsoft they will probably pay an increasing role in helping pp spread he said looking into pp s future file sharing is just the beginning for pp networks as far as mr broes is concerned once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said file sharing is the tip of the iceberg

big war games battle it out the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the original s elements for its part the long running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapting the console game rising sun call of duty finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war battlefronts including russia and north africa it is a traditional first person viewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you on a near identical note medal of honor pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight knit team and plum in the middle of all out action its arenas are the war s pacific battles including guadalcanal and pearl harbour you play one character throughout a raw and rather talkative us soldier both games rely on a carefully stage managed structure that keeps things ticking along when this works it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story when it does not it is tedious a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the anti aircraft guns it is one of the finest set pieces ever seen in a video game this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre determined path forcibly witnessing a series of pre set moments of action is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic the genius of something like half life is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection this pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting a full on atmospheric experience call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation finest hour has a similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voice overs letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat the game s drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc the mouse control is a big reason why along with the sharper graphics a top end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety call of duty on pc was more detailed plot wise and graphically and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready targeting with the ps controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collision detection you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again the game wants to be a challenge and is and many players will like it for that it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour and in pacific assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all of the two games pacific assault gets more things right including little points like auto saving intelligently and having tidier presentation it engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we had to ramp up the settings on a high spec machine to get the most out of them finest hour is by no means bad and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent
fast moving phone viruses appear security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range the cabir virus only affects high end handsets running the symbian series phone operating system despite the warnings there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir the original cabir worm came to light in mid june when it was sent to anti virus firms as a proof of concept program a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time however the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices finnish security firm f secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone s battery anti virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november symbian s series software is licenced by nokia lg electronics lenovo panasonic samsung sendo and siemens
games win for blu ray dvd format the next generation dvd format blu ray is winning more supporters than its rival according to its backers blu ray backed by firms including sony is competing against toshiba and nec backed hd dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games the blu ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format the next generation of dvds will hold high definition video and sound this offers incredible d like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of as we move from standard definition video images to high definition images we have a much greater need for storage richard doherty from panasonic s hollywood laboratories one of the pioneers of blu ray told the bbc news website so by utilising blue laser based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today s dvd a blu ray disc will be able to store gb of high quality data while toshiba s hd dvd will hold gb mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high definition needs including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders both toshiba and blu ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the s can be resolved over the next year when next generation dvd players start to come out when players do come out they will be able to play standard dvds too which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu ray in the battle for supremacy gaming is a billion industry worldwide so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical disc technologies said michael heilmann chief technology officer for vivendi universal blu ray offers the capacity performance and high speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming ea a leading games developer and publisher added that the delivery of high definition games of the future was vital and blu ray had the capacity functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations mr doherty said gamers were ravenous for high quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles gamers especially those working on pcs are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures deeper levels for delivering higher resolution playback he added the focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated d models and textures and increasing the resolution increasing the frame rate all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost as games move to more photo real capability the current technology is limiting they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments said mr doherty currently graphics intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation high definition dvds will cut down on that need likewise consoles rely on single discs so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better high resolution games blu ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios such as mgm studios disney and buena vista as well as top technology firms like dell lg samsung and phillips amongst others while toshiba s hd dvd technology has won backing from paramount universal and warner bros the real world benefits of hd dvd are apparent and obvious said jim cardwell president of warner home video mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd dvd both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox but discussions are still on going next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world and runs from to january
apple mac mini gets warm welcome the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans industry experts and pc users the release of the tiny low cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy to use and administer second home computer it s the bravest move they have made yet said jonny evans news editor at macworld magazine mr evans said the combination of low cost small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware it s deeply affordable he said plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems already he said pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple s store and the show struggled to cope with demand according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs speech suffered lengthy response times the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline i think fundamentally it s a good idea because it s cheap even for a pc said nick ross deputy labs editor at pc pro apple s work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans he said i think people expect it just to work now and really it should hesaid the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer he said for browsing the web e mail and all kinds of basic duties it s going to be absolutely adequate said mr ross ian fogg broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research agreed that the mac mini could be very popular apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac he said before now he said apple has been seen as a premium brand but he said the mac mini changed that perception it s a particularly good price when you see that it s apple that is doing it he said apple expects the mac mini to sell for in the uk and in the us adding extras such as a larger hard drive more memory and networking options will increase the basic price it will go on sale from january for consumers interested in style design and small size which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in it s a natural next step said mr fogg apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at said mr fogg who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers other than ipod owners would find using the machine he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor they d be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost he said those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals such as display keyboard and mouse the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music movies and images people accumulate said mr fogg the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet he said it does not have the right connectors that fit a tv screen or enough storage said mr fogg it s very much a computer one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage vice president of research at analysts gartner he said i do n t think it changes the world although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer it was still expensive compared to many pcs also he said it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer the pc world is a pile em high sell em cheap market he said and all of them are pretty interchangeable since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long slow decline he said every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again said mr gammage the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend he said
mobiles get set for visual radio the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but could see another big innovation that wo n t just see a change in our mobile phone habits it might alter the way we listen to the radio finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius a senior project manager at nokia was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium he said i m very happy to say it s not television what we re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today if you have a visual radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you do n t know or there s a competition or vote that you d like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on air broadcast you ve just been listening to that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in a similar way to digital television s red button content possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real time basis this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network and there will be a cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it ll be two or three pounds per month said mr wasenius but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial up connections one thing that is for sure assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be million visual radio enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of basically visual radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners station manager steve taylor commented listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like mp music downloads and the latest gig tickets initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon the and but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them listen again to the interview on the radio five live website
gamers could drive high definition tv films and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens it is called high definition hd for short and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us it is set according to analysts to do for images what cds did for sound different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive but europe s gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand europeans will have to wait until at least until they see mainstream hdtv to view it it needs to be transmitted in hd format and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high quality resolution the next generation of consoles however are expected to start appearing at the end of start of and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high resolution pictures in the next generation of consoles hd support is mandatory dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website every game is going to be playable in hd so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs and who have no content to watch are going to be blown away by these really high detail pictures it s going to change really the way they look at gaming at the end of last year chris deering sony s european president made a prediction that million european households would have hdtv sets by a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at million by an increase from an estimated sets at the end of but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology about if there are few programmes or films to watch on them satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by until broadcast rights format standards and the practicalities of updating equipment are agreed tv content will be limited all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen and scan lines which go down the screen most standard uk tv pictures are made up of lines and about pixels hd offers up to active lines with each line made up of pixels this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv probably in the uk gaming is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off as in look what this tv can do until hd is really adopted by broadcasters explains dr tuffy but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics and more immersive gaming experiences they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game s requirements demographics have changed too and the sweet spot for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late s this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big screen high definition display technologies and hd projectors earlier than others higher capacity storage discs such as hd dvd and blue ray are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles allowing developers more room for detailed graphics for console developers though hd offers some production changes it could make games production slightly more expensive thinks dr tuffy but we may see the cross platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console he says you are literally going to get to the point with a lord of the rings game for example is going to be closer and closer to the actual film especially the cgi stuff from the dvd and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game just now they have almost got it seamless with hd he says the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big screen cinema release this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide at that point says dr tuffy games could become more or less interactive movies
how to make a greener computer the hi tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware bill thompson thinks it s about time my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge now you ca n t buy petrol with lead additives and we re all better off as a result chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic mercury cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops mobiles and music players one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive a well designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears it is as they say about time we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage the car engine is a case in point lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder a phenomenon called knocking so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work so it took decades before it was done we re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and as a result there are billions of devices from old mobile phones to antique handhelds that will have to be recycled in years to come if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc keeping the monitor and other peripherals even if apple does not get its way four or five year old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it s not unreasonable to replace them but what do we do with the old ones i ve just looked around my office and i find two monitors an old pc two old handhelds three ancient laptops four antique mobile phones a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use they are all old enough to be hazardous waste the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead but it s possible that some of the components could be useful i could take them up the to the council recycling centre but it s a mile drive away across town and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste a box for glass cans and paper that can be recycled and a black bin for the rest there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too i d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box at least eventually bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
what s next for next gen consoles the next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers we may not know when they will be released what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain they are coming sony microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next months the details of playstation xbox codename xenon and nintendo s so called revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless we know maybe what the ps will do but we can only guess said rory armes studio general manager for video game giant electronic arts in europe it s a horrendous effort in the first year he admitted microsoft had delivered development kits to ea said mr armes but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits although the details may not be nailed down mr armes said ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines the rumours are that playstation will have a little more under the hood than xbox he said microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost while sony has more experience in hardware i think sony will be able to push more into a box at cost what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle while short on detail he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a pc and offer great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people more communications more media more connectivity sony is thought to have a similar vision for ps while nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower gary dunn development director at codemasters said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles we are working on new libraries of effects a lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in pc gaming such as pixel shaders and normal mapping mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real world physics to be a major part of the new consoles we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game in the first year at least developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high end graphics cards for pcs should be expected simon gardner president of climax s action studio said it s definitely an exciting time we want to give more freedom to the player we want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play the environments will be much more believable and dramatic growing and changing as you play there will be a breadth of effects more involving worlds to play in it s a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush we re being given more tools for the average consumer we can get things of a more filmic quality gerhard florin head of ea in europe said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games many will be sceptical gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware but this time it would seem to be more likely ps will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies said mr florin he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles a gamer could buy a starter disc for euros when he goes home he goes online and he could buy ai and levels as you go it s much smarter if you can get levels as you go mr armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium in some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware go in the opposite direction we have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity what we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories mr gardner agreed we can thrown more polygons around and have better ai but if it does n t make for a better game then that s not very useful developers will certainly have the tools with the new machines but how they employ them is still to be decided
mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing a brief round up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below part two will follow on monday reviews of call of duty splinter cell pandora tomorrow lord of the rings and pocket kingdom will follow on monday if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time even before nokia s n gage game phone launched in late many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles there are shoot em ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie in increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use d graphics the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short range radio technology with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing too fast too furious digital bridges as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games because i m rubbish at them no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit winning gives you cash for upgrades graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play fatal force macrospace a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth graphics are a bit cartoon like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring both background music and sounds effects work well the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while with the right power up you can go into a

more women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks according to a two year study the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus spam and spyware attacks rose by each year between and the study for net security firm preventon shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers it is thought that of those buying home net security programs are retired for the last three years that has gone up by an average of but more retired women were buying security software than retired men the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers the study predicts that of all home pc net security buyers will be women in they could even overtake men as the main buyers by if current rates persist according to the research i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong said one over woman who took part in the research you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last years paul goosens head of preventon told the bbc news website now we are seeing real people both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online particuarly if they are new to broadband he said programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial up users with a slower connection too said mr goosens security software should be easy to use with simple interfaces and instructions written in non technical language he added the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e mail viruses high profile complaints about rogue diallers and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti virus firewall and spyware removal programs too without protection these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally more than pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses a study from security from symantec showed last year viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer according to net security experts programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs many based in eastern europe over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because said mr goosens they are reported in the press much more you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat they are asking the right questions he explained it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider that they are safe to connect to the net an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes by the end of the year it is thought that more than of uk homes will have broadband net access in july last year the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial up for the first time according to the office of national statistics
why cell will get the hard sell the world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time but what is so important about it and why is it so different the backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry ibm is one of the largest and most respected chip makers in the world providing cutting edge technology to large businesses sony will be using the chip inside its playstation console and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms the technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary from a technical standpoint traditional computers whether they are household pcs or playstation s use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer the cell technology on the other hand uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously this gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors whilst its rivals are working on similar technology it is sony s which is the most advanced the speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is a huge leap in performance using a technology called xdr created by american firm rambus memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by intel perhaps more important than any of the technology is the cell s role in the imminent war on living rooms the big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as dvd players and hi fis companies like microsoft and sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the tv of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its windows media center software which has been adopted by many pc makers sony had a stab at something similar with the psx a variation on the playstation last year in japan although this attempt was generally seen as a failure both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles to make them as powerful as pcs will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoyed by microsoft and intel is not allowed to extend to this market by creating a radically new architecture and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room shutting out their rivals once they have established themselves under the tv there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional pcs and instigate a regime change on the desktop cell is in fact specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house the links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systems sony hopes to put cells in televisions kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip each cell will be linked to the others creating a vast home network of computing power resources of the cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other so that you can programme your microwave from your tv for example this digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are as with all things a number of reasons it could fail because the processor is so different it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without a fight microsoft is going to be pushing its xbox as hard as possible to make sure that its technology not sony s will be under your tree next christmas intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell so that it does n t lose its desktop pc dominance if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice however it could provide the jump start to the fully digital home of the future the revolution might not be televised but it could well be played with a videogame controller
playstation processor unveiled the cell processor which will drive sony s playstation will run times faster than current pc chips its designers have said sony ibm and toshiba who have been working on the cell processor for three years unveiled the chip on monday it is being designed for use in graphics workstations the new playstation console and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip the chip will run at speeds of greater than ghz the firms said by comparison rival chip maker intel s fastest processor runs at ghz details of the chip were released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco the new processor is set to ignite a fresh battle between intel and the cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products the playstation is expected in while toshiba plans to incorporate it into high end televisions next year ibm has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year cell is comprised of several computing engines or cores a core based on ibm s power architecture controls eight synergistic processing centres in all they can simultaneously carry out instruction sequences compared with two for current intel chips later this year intel and advanced micro devices plan to release their own multicore chips which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once the cell s specifications suggest the playstation will offer a significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in a product announcement will find their way into systems any new technology like this has two components said steve kleynhans an analyst with meta group he said it has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it then there s the reality of how it s really going to be used which generally is several levels down the chain from there while the playstation is likely to be the first mass market product to use cell the chip s designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications from servers to mobile phones initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console however because the first version of the cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan and while marketing speak describes the chip as a supercomputer it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world s top supercomputers ibm said cell was os neutral and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if microsoft s windows was among those tested with the chip if cell is to challenge intel s range of chips in the marketplace it will need to find itself inside pcs which predominantly run using windows
consumer concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id rfid tags in shops a survey says more than half of people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low the survey of consumers in the uk france germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini the firm works on behalf of more than firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner each item contains a unique identification number more than half of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties ard jan vetham capgemini s principal consultant on rfid said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers the industry can reach this point he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items they are also in use as a passcard for the m toll in the midlands in the uk mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology at least once consumer group consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering caspian has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing all kinds of personal belongings including clothes could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners it warned
mobile audio enters new dimension as mobile phones move closer to being a ubiquitous all in one media player audio is becoming ever more important but how good can that sound be from such a small device the sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head the surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone british firm sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed d audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers firms amd and srs both offer stereo widening technology for mobile phones but sonaptic s managing director david monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional d audio on a mobile there are quite a few basic technologies out there making the sound seem a bit bigger headphones a bit nicer no one has really tried before to make proper d positional audio where an individual channel can be moved around sonaptic has been working with japanese mobile network ntt docomo to set standards for d audio on mobile phones in the last few months handsets from nec fujitsu and mitsubishi have been released on to the japanese marker which have chips produced by yamaha and rohm with sonaptic s technology the technology has been around on pcs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone said mr monteith the technology works through applying the science of psychoacoustics and grew out of medical research done by the company s research director dr alastair sibbald we are basically trying to fool your ears into thinking sound is coming from areas it actually is n t your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset the structure of the ear works as a d encoder for sound helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating sonaptic s audio processing algorithms mimic that d encoding giving the impression that sound is coming from the left right and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source mr montieth says if the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear the shape of your ear causes differences in sound from one ear to the other we are synthesising those differences sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading handhelds often have limitations screens will be small by definition if you want to get impact from media you are running either a movie a game or watching tv if you want it to be more immersive then our technology can help a fishing game is the first title to use the technology creating a d sound field while the gamer plays driving games and shoot em ups using the technology are in development the technology can also be used for music giving songs a much more expansive and immersive feel sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing it s important we only use or of the processor otherwise you wo n t be able to play a game on the handset explained mr montieth the company is now looking to the us and european markets where it has been working with network vodafone we have focused first on japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market we knew japan would be the first place to have the handsets that could use our technology there should be handsets out in the uk in the next six months
dvd copy protection strengthened dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most but not all of the current dvd ripping copying programs used to pirate dvds ripguard is designed to reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer said the firm macrovision said the new technology will work in nearly all current dvd players when applied to the discs but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard some bbc news website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that dvds will not work on pcs running the operating system linux the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last months taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download ultimately we see ripguard dvd evolving beyond anti piracy and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions interoperability in tomorrow s digital home and the upcoming high definition formats said steve weinstein executive vice president and general manager of macrovision s entertainment technologies group macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against rent rip and return where people would rent a dvd copy it and then return the original ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of the company said the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs if used those programs will now most likely crash the company said macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti copying measures
intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has said it has found a way to put a silicon based laser on a chip raising hopes of much faster networks scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade we ve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel s photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high volume manufacturing have been solved we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy to make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semi conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses it s a technical validation that it can work he said
us woman sues over ink cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard hp saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re filling even when it does not the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february hp the world s biggest printer firm declined to comment on the lawsuit hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer the suit said the lawsuit is asking for restitution damages and other compensation the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last months the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as but it could cost up to in running costs over an month period due to cartridge a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uk s office of fair trading oft which concluded in a report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers
mobile networks seek turbo boost third generation mobile g networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the gsm world congress in cannes last week fast g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service says the global mobile suppliers association at gsm siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second up to times faster than current g networks the system is not available commercially yet but motorola the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access a high speed high bandwidth technology available now early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than kilobits per second kbps on standard g networks high speed downlink packet access hsdpa sometimes called super g will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips according to a report published by uk based research consultancy analysys a number of companies are developing the technology nokia and canada based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of mbps practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide area networks said dr alastair brydon author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of g with hsdpa and other enhancements the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which even at this lower rate will more than double the capacity when compared to basic wcdma g he added motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor g cell using a single hsdpa device but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution data optimised ev do us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its g network at the end of last year we are expanding our network and deploying ev do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds said oliver valente sprint s vice president for technology development when the contract was announced as part of bn in multi year contracts announced late last year sprint will spend around bn on ev do technology from lucent technologies nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of megabits a second and peak download rates of mbps mmo the uk based operator with services in the uk ireland and germany has opted for technology based on hsdpa using technology from lucent it will offer data speeds of mbps from next summer on its isle of man g network and will eventually support speeds of up to mbps us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson siemens plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today but christoph caselitz president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in the need for transmission capacities for voice data image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of siemens in collaboration with the fraunhofer german sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae instead of the usual one this enables a data transmission such as sending a big file or video to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band the speeds offered by g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for g licences but today instead of connecting to the internet by slow dial up phone connection many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of megabits a second much faster than g this means users are likely to find g disappointing unless the networks are souped up if they are n t those lucrative power users such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory it still has to assess the mobility of multiple antennae devices and conduct field trials a commercial system could be as far away as though siemens did not rule out an earlier date
mac mini heralds mini revolution the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month but does the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things dealt with at the outset yes the mac mini is really really small and yes it is another piece of inspired apple design there is more to be said on the computer s size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer inside that small box there is a g processor a cd dvd player a hard drive some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system a dvd burner wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost and if you do not have a monitor keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications apple software the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x the operating system as well as ilife a suite of software which includes itunes web browser safari iphoto garage band and idvd i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x of course users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs for people who want to do interesting things with their music photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer it s a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses said mark sparrow technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine he added in essence it s a laptop in a biscuit tin minus the screen and the keyboard the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically savvy to experiment with their macs one user has already created a dock to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in car entertainment playing movies and music as well as navigation another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes music films and photos partly due to its small living room friendly design but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case at least not in the here and now the hard drive at gb for the larger model is too small to be realistically used as media centre while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content a media centre computer has to store music files and photos and as such gb just seems too small most pcs running windows media center have at least gb hard disks coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is not what it is not but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses so is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing graham barlow editor of mac format understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint it s just a mac but we should be very excited it s revolutionary in its size smaller than pcs looks looks better than pcs and the fact that it s the first mac designed to really go for the low cost pc market the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland bulky boxes there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini itx motherboards but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home build enthusiast or expensive pre built options based around microsoft s media center software but for the value the mac mini offers bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before apple is to be congratulated let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution it is a mini revolution
can yahoo dominate next decade yahoo has reached the grand old age of and in internet years that is a long time for many yahoo remains synonymous with the internet a veteran that managed to ride the dot com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web s top brands but for others there is another newer net icon threatening to overshadow yahoo in the post dot com world google the veteran and the upstart have plenty in common yahoo was the first internet firm to offer initial public shares and google was arguably the most watched ipo initial public offering of the post dot com era both began life as search engines although in when yahoo chose google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business it was very much yahoo that commanded press attention in recent years the column inches have stacked up in google s favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as gmail its shopping channel froogle and google news for jupiter analyst olivier beauvillain yahoo s initial decision to put its investment on search on hold was an error yahoo was busy building a portal and while it was good to diversify they made a big mistake in outsourcing search to google he said they thought google would just be a technology provider but it has become a portal in its own right and a direct competitor he added he believes yahoo failed to see how crucial search would become to internet users something it has rediscovered in recent years it is interesting that in these last few years it has refocused on search following the success of google he said but for allen weiner a research director at analyst firm gartner and someone who has followed yahoo s progress since the early years the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it search technology is valuable but the next generation of search is going to be about premium content and the interface that users have to that content he said he believes the rivalry between google and yahoo is overblown and instead thinks the real battle is going to be between yahoo and msn it is a battle that yahoo is currently winning he believes microsoft has amazing assets including software capability and a global name but it has yet to show me it can create a rival product to yahoo he said he is convinced yahoo remains the single most important brand on the world wide web i believe yahoo is the seminal brand on the web if you are looking for a text book definition of web portal then yahoo is it he said it has achieved this dominance mr weiner believes by a canny combination of acquisitions such as that of inktomi and overture and by avoiding direct involvement in either content creation or internet access that is not to say that yahoo has n t had its dark days when the dot com bubble burst it lost one third of its revenue in a single year bore a succession of losses and saw its market value fall from a peak of bn to bn at one point crucial to its survival was the decision to replace chief executive tim koogle with terry semel in may thinks mr weiner his business savvy coupled with the technical genius of founder jerry yang has proved a winning combination he says so as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as a survivor how will it fare as it enters its teenage years the game is theirs to lose and msn is the only one that stands in the way of yahoo s domination predicted mr weiner nick hazel yahoo s head of consumer services in the uk thinks the fact that yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead search will be a key focus as will making yahoo messenger available on mobiles forging new broadband partnerships such as that with bt in the uk and continuing to provide a range of services beyond the desktop he says mr weiner thinks yahoo s vision of becoming the ultimate gateway to the web will move increasing towards movies and television as more and more people get broadband access it will spread its portal wings to expand into rich media he predicts
looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner more than million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date the figure was more than in and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in said analysts although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slow down in replacement sales all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years time they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner third generation mobiles g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who do n t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms more likely to drive sales in would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services the motorola razr v phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in she added this was not a women s thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self expression too it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi people are after something that is nice looking and together with that there is the entertainment side this year music will have a part to play in this the market for full track music downloads was worth just million million in but is set to be worth billion million by according to juniper research sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w which combines a digital music player with up to hours battery life and a two megapixel camera in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life
domain system opens door to scams a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers a trade body has warned the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force but the uk internet forum ukif is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers says stephen dyer director of ukif domain names are the real language addresses of websites rather than their internet protocol address which is a series of numbers they are used so people can more easily navigate the web so called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used so for example website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian a look just like an english a but the computer code would be different and the site it would lead users to could be a fake this is more than just a theory a fake paypal com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name idn system said mr dyer as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent mr dyer said although the idn problem is well known in technical circles the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked said mr dyer it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site he added there are solutions for instance browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers another solution to introduce idn disabled browsers could be a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water he said centr the council of european national top level domain registries agrees a rush to introduce idn disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns a technology that is desperately needed in the non english speaking world the organisation said in a statement

ultra fast wi fi nears completion ultra high speed wi fi connections moved closer to reality on thursday when intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year intel is developing ultra wideband technology uwb which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs uwb is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless usb devices which need low power consumption a rival uwb standard is being developed by motorola and chip firm freescale at the mobile phone conference gsm in cannes last month samsung demonstrated a phone using uwb technology from freescale at a press conference on thursday intel announced that two uwb groups wimedia alliance and multi band ofdm alliance had merged to support the technology uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second consumer electronics companies want uwb to replace cables and simplify set up jeff ravencraft technology strategist at intel and chairman of the wireless usb promoter group told technology site zdnet thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer could n t set up the equipment the first products using uwb technology from intel are due to hit the market later this year initially they will be products using wireless usb connections uwb could also be used to create so called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves the technology works over a range up to metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data intel says the benefit of uwb is that it does not interfere with other wi fi technologies already in use such as wi fi wimax and mobile phone networks

broadband set to revolutionise tv bt is starting its push into television with plans to offer tv over broadband as a telecoms company bt is moving to a content distribution strategy andrew burke chief of bt s new entertainment unit told the iptv world forum we want to be an entertainment facilitator he said on the opening day of the london conference the bbc is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non licence fee payers overseas the corporation s interactive media player imp is its first foray into broadband tv known as iptv internet protocol tv we see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers said bt s andrew burke with more people on broadband and connection speeds increasing telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it increased competition between net service providers encouraged by ofcom has eroded bt s position in the market it is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over adsl a reality it also sees delivering tv over broadband as a way of getting high definition hd content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional regular broadcasts the bbc s imp has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in before it officially launches the bbc must show the government how it offers value for money delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value says the bbc because it gives people more control and more choice iptv is a similar idea to voip services like skype both use broadband net connections to carry information like video and voice in packets of data instead of conventional means since it uses internet technology iptv could mean more choice of programmes more more interactivity tailored programming and more localised content outside of conventional satellite digital cable and terrestrial broadcasts it is all part of the larger changing tv technology landscape and like personal digital video recorders pvrs gives people much more control over tv broadcasters see iptv and pvrs as both as a threat and an opportunity the bbc recognises that tv over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it said rahul chakkara controller of bbci s interactive tv services the imp is based on peer to peer technology and lets people download programmes the bbc owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast iptv enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times said mr chakkara so we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for via the licence fee they can access it any time they want it helps said mr burke that people are more au fait with terms like digital interactive now that digital tv reaches more than of uk homes according to benoit joly from broadband telecoms firm thales of europe cannot get satellite tv or digital tv they could get iptv though analysts say that iptv will account for of the digital tv market in europe alone by the end of the decade what needs to happen now agree analysts is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service mbps connections would be ideal bt does not see itself as a broadcaster of iptv services rather as an enabler said mr burke its strategy is a hybrid approach he explained where over the air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband initially appealing to niche markets like sports fans it will widen out but iptv could be used for home monitoring pet cams localised news services and local authority tv too says bt it even suggests that it could target those households in the uk that do not own a computer of the country broadband to them would not be about data and the net that could come later for them but about cheap phone calls and more choice of tv programmes home choice already offers hours of shows and channels delivered over broadband to homes in london with a broadband net subscription you can also get your tv and phone service through content deals and partnerships it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues it aims to expand nationally but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its subscribers now and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer although still at a very early stage iptv is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network another utility like electricity

anti tremor mouse stops pc shakes a special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed the device uses similar steady cam technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition said the uk national tremor foundation using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we re delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem said karen walsh from the uk national tremor foundation most commonly associated with tremors is parkinson s disease but they can also be caused by other conditions like essential tremor et tremors more often affect older people but can hit all ages et for example is genetic and can afflict people throughout their lives the assistive mouse adapter ama is the brainchild of ibm researcher jim levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle who has parkinson s disease struggle with mouse control i knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world including the elderly the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages and at the same time the need for computer access grows he said computer users plug the device into a pc and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is it is also able to recognise multiple clicking on a mouse button caused by shaky digits ibm said it would partner up with a small uk based electronics firm montrose secam to produce the devices which will cost about james cosgrave one of the company s directors said it would make a big difference to those with tremors i m a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane he said but using a pc has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen he said a prototype of the gadget had transformed his life the device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier last year the office for national statistics reported that for the first time more than half of all households in britain had a home computer with prices getting cheaper to get online too computer ownership is increasing but although of british people have tried the internet only of britons aged or over have been online more than six million uk households now have a broadband net by the middle of it is estimated that of all uk net users will be on broadband there are still millions using the net through dial up connections too
the pirates with no profit motive two men who were part of a huge network of internet software pirates known as drink or die have been convicted at the old bailey bbc news investigates how the network worked and what motivated those involved they called themselves drink or die dod they were a network of computer buffs who derived pleasure from cracking codes protecting copyrighted software such as windows they would then share it with each other there is no suggestion any of them profited financially but the authorities in both britain and the united states considered it software piracy and took a dim view of networks such as dod one of a number of so called warez organisations operating on the internet in october the us customs service began an investigation into dod and other networks such as razor risciso myth and popz fourteen months later us customs co ordinated a series of raids across the globe as part of operation buccaneer seventy search warrants were executed in the us britain australia norway sweden and finland at least people were arrested worldwide of them in the us among the leaders of the network were americans john sankus known by his internet nickname eriflleh hellfire spelt backwards richard berry kent kartadinata and christopher tresco who used a server based at the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology mit the longest jail sentence months was handed down to sankus a year old from philadelphia us attorney paul mcnulty said at the time john sankus and his techno gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught they were wrong these sentences and those to follow should send a message to others entertaining similar beliefs of invincibility but one man still in legal limbo is british born australian hew raymond griffiths who is still fighting against extradition to the us us customs claimed mr griffiths was one of dod s leaders but his lawyer antony townsden told the bbc news website it was a laughable suggestion and added he was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he could n t even download software the allegation that he was the group s co leader is illusory he had the least technical skills of anyone he could n t crack any codes and he has only been called a leader because he was a loudmouth who wrote a lot on their messageboard mr townsden said if he had committed any crimes he should be prosecuted in australia not the us he claimed the australian government s decision to accept the extradition request was typical of their current acquiescent attitude to the us mr griffiths is expecting to hear this week the outcome of his appeal against the decision to extradite him those involved would give themselves internet aliases which would act in the same way as tags used by graffiti artists they could then brag about their code cracking abilities without giving away their real identities alex bell whose trial at the old bailey ended on friday was known as mr after a computer device while his co defendant steven dowd s nickname curiously was tim a spokesman for us immigration customs and enforcement dean boyd said dod did not appear to be motivated by money their motivation was the kudos which surrounded being able to crack sophisticated software he told the bbc news website primarily they were just interested in how fast they could crack the code it was all about underground notoriety but mr boyd pointed out that once the software had been distributed on the internet it fell into the hands of organised criminals who were able to mass produce pirated software at zero cost it cost us industries a lot of money billions of dollars he said mr boyd said it was truly global in scope we raided a number of universities including duke in north carolina and mit and found that several of the people involved were employed by major computer corporations they would go home from work in the evenings and get involved in this warez culture warez groups which began to surface in the early s operate according to a strict code of honour for example if one group cracked the software first its rivals would respect that achievement and not seek to claim it themselves mr boyd said the destruction of dod was a great coup but he added i m not going to sit here and say we have sorted the problem there are still hackers and people who do this for fun internet piracy of computer software remains a gigantic problem a spokesman for the business software alliance said dod members claim they did not profit at all but they did profit by getting access to very expensive servers he said dod and other warez groups were fostering a culture of piracy on the internet he said of computer software in britain was believed to have been pirated and this cost bn in revenue for software companies their suppliers and distributors it may seem like a victimless crime but it touches more people than you might care to believe
apple makes blogs reveal sources apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december following online articles about apple s asteroid product now apple has won the right to see e mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit a lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters apple s lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage apple insider and think secret websites all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value the lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the power page and apple insider sites the separate legal fight with think secret has yet to be resolved in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg apple can now get its hands on e mail records from the bloggers net providers in making his ruling judge kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest california has so called shield laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest the judge wrote it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of hits on a website about apple have and will happen but an interested public is not the same as the public interest judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists too the electronic frontier foundation which is acting as legal counsel for power page and apple insider said the ruling had potentially wide implications anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling said eff lawyer kurt opsahl mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent

have hackers recruited your pc more than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than networks of remotely controlled machines the largest network of so called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of hijacked home computers data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them the detailed look at zombie or bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as honey pots to attract hackers and gather information about how they work while bot nets have been known about for some time estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely to gather its information the german arm of the honeynet project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy the longest time a honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes the shortest compromise time was only a few seconds the research found that once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine many well known vulnerabilities in the windows operating system were exploited by bot net controllers to find and take over target machines especially coveted were home pcs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off the months of surveillance revealed that the different bot nets which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines are used for a variety of purposes many are used as relays for spam to route unwanted adverts to pc users or as launch platforms for viruses but the research team found that many are put to very different uses during the monitoring period the team saw bot nets used to launch distributed denial of service attacks on separate targets these attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target using a bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against one ddos attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline other bot nets were used to abuse the google adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games criminals also seem to be starting to use bot nets for mass identity theft to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data leveraging the power of several thousand bots it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly said the researchers even in unskilled hands it should be obvious that bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon

confusion over high definition tv now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital tv dvds and digital video recorders the next revolution for tv is being prepared for our sets in most corners of tv and technology industries high definition hdtv is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour hd essentially makes tv picture quality at least four times better than now but there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about hd on the high street thousands of flat panel screens lcds liquid crystal displays plasma screens and dlp rear projection tv sets have already been sold as hd but are in fact not able to display hd the uk is the largest display market in europe according to john binks director of gfk which monitors global consumer markets but he added of all the flat panel screens sold just in the uk are capable of getting high definition there are different devices that are being sold as hd but are not hd ready according to alexander oudendijk senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant astra they may be fantastic quality tvs but many do not have adaptors in them called dvi or hdmi high definition multimedia interface connectors which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the high street say industry experts who gathered at bafta in london for the nd european hdtv summit last week we have to be careful about consumer confusion there is a massive education process to go through said mr binks the industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it eventually that will be everyone the bbc is currently developing plans to produce all its tv output to meet hdtv standards by preparations for the analogue switch off are already underway in some areas and programmes are being filmed with hd cameras bskyb plans to ship its first generation set top boxes to receive hdtv broadcasts in time for christmas like its sky boxes they will also be personal video recorders pvrs the company will start broadcasts of hdtv programmes offering them as premium channel packages concentrating to start with on sports big events and films in early but the set top box which receives hdtv broadcasts has to plug into a display tv set that can show the images at the much higher resolution that hd demands if hdtv is to be real by of homes in the uk will have some sort of tv set or display that can show hd in its full glory but it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to being digital as a result all the key players those who make flat panel displays as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters formed a hd forum in to make sure they were all talking to each other part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection but it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for from next month all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a hd ready sticker this also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and hdtv signals and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry the logo is absolutely the way forward said david mercer analysts with strategy analytics but it is still not appearing on many retail products the industry is upbeat that the sticker will help but it is only a start we can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers said mr oudendijk there may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months the european broadcast union ebu is testing different flavours of hd formats to prepare for even better hdtv further down the line it is similarly concerned that people get the right information on hdtv formats as well as which devices will support the formats we believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile said phil laven technical director for the ebu the tv display manufacturers want us to watch hd on screens that are at least in cm to get the true impact of hd they say although smaller displays suffice what may convince people to spend money on hd ready devices is the falling prices which continue to tumble across europe the prices are dropping an average of every year according to analysts lcd prices dropped by in europe as a whole last year according to mr oudendijk

bad e mail habits sustains spam the bad behaviour of e mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry a new study has found according to a survey conducted by security firm mirapoint and market research company the radicati group nearly a third of e mail users have clicked on links in spam messages one in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e mail accounts the fact that one in ten e mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little the report concludes this preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us said marcel nienhuis market analyst at the radicati group it explains why e mail security threats including spam viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate he said accusing users of bad e mail behaviour spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month according to security firm clearswift it has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney sony psp giveaways and in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the american drama series desperate housewives it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex but rather than finding a companion users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their pc clearswift has seen a rise in sex related spam over the course of the last month without casting aspersions those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that one thing leads to another but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems said alyn hockey clearswift s director of research sexually explicit terms make up of security firm sophos top word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti spam filters spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by pass anti spam software said graham cluley senior technology consultant for security firm sophos the list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites money drugs and sex said mr cluley but anti spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e mail people must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails spammers are criminals plain and simple if no one responded to junk e mail and did n t buy products sold in this way then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs he said

local net tv takes off in austria an austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television the people of engerwitzdorf are filming editing and producing their own regional news channel the channel covers local politics sports events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on pcs the pilot has been so successful that telekom austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere it s growing unbelievably fast said rudolf fischer head of telekom austria s fixed line division the trial of buntes fernsehen multi coloured tv was started in late and creates a net based tv station run by the residents of engerwitzdorf the hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by telekom austria but this equipment following training has been turned over to the villagers any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a buntes fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch most people watch the tv on their home pc and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes in the first four months of the project villagers have created films and put together regular reports on local news items they have adopted it very quickly said mr fischer they like the possibility to create their own content and see what s going on in the area it s kind of the democratisation of local tv he said because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region the buntes fernsehen project has been such a success that telekom austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas mr fischer said it was taking the roll out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes the engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of telekom austria s online tv channel aon which lets people watch programmes on their pc aon streams a couple of live channels plus sports news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay for download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it in october a larger tv on demand project is due to launch in vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net
rolling out next generation s net the body that oversees how the net works grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last years but it is just the start in a sense we have hardly started in reaching the whole population the new chair of the internet engineering task force ietf brian carpenter says the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net s architecture with broadband take up growing services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net i think voip voice over internet protocol allowing phone calls to be made over the net is very important it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms says dr carpenter second it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure with voip you need very little infrastructure a distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent years at cern the european laboratory for particle physics as the new chair of the ietf his next big challenge is overseeing ipv the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web at cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web so he is well placed to take on such a task the net s growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work are open and free for anyone to use and work with the net is built on a protocol called tcp ip which means transmission control protocol and internet protocol when computers communicate with the net a unique ip address is used to send and receive information the ietf is a large international community of network designers operators vendors and researchers working on the evolution of the net s architecture and the way this information is sent and received they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps we ve seen some interesting effects over last few years explains dr carpenter the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the s then there was a bit of a glitch in we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies like china which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies the number of broadband subscribers via dsl digital subscriber line doubled in a year to million according to figures released at the end of the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate explained dr carpenter given it the net was designed for the whole community it has done well to reach millions if you want to reach the whole population you have to make sure it can scale up ipv the standard that will replace the existing ipv will allow for billions more addresses on the net and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world the actual number of addresses with ipv is limited to four billion ip addresses that clearly is not enough when you have billion people to serve so there is technical solution the new version of ip ipv it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits said dr carpenter standards are vital to something as complex as the net and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task the difference this next generation standard ipv will make to the average net user is almost invisible our first goal is that it ipv should make no difference people should not notice a difference it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer a lot of the process will be invisible people are usually given an ip address without knowing it technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled said dr carpenter the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security to dr carpenter the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour people have to be educated about sensible behaviour he says such as ignoring e mails that claim you have won something i do n t think it is going to get worse people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards it is a never ending battle in a sense but he adds even if security has improved you still worry a bit unfortunately it is just part of life we have a duty to do what we can
long life promised for laptop pcs scientists are working on ways to ensure laptops can stay powered for an entire working day building batteries from new chemical mixes could boost power significantly say industry experts the changes include everything from the way chips for laptops are made to tricks that reduce the power consumption of displays ever since laptops appeared the amount of time they last between recharges has been a frustration for users a survey carried out in by forrester research found that the shortness of battery life was the most complained about feature of laptops the focus back then was more on performance and features said mike trainor chief mobile technology evangelist for chip giant intel for most of the s battery life was stuck on two to hours but now he said laptops can last much longer it was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs he explained other changes are needed to get to the holy grail of a laptop running for about eight hours before needing a recharge lithium ion is never going to get there by itself he said the industry has done a great job of wringing all possible energy storage out of that technology that they can some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space said mr trainor though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing he was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs in fuel cells you need to have pumps and separators and evaporation chambers he said it s a mini energy plant that needs to be shrunk and shrunk and shrunk intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry this work has led to the creation of the mobile pc extended battery life ebl working group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking said mr trainor intel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they need on a larger scale said mr trainor improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient also said mr trainor research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptop many laptop makers have committed to creating and inch screens that draw only three watts of power this is far below the power consumption levels of screens in current notebooks if we can get close to eight hours that s a place that people see as extraordinarily valuable that s what the industry has to deliver mr trainor said
net fingerprints combat attacks eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically the system creates digital fingerprints of ongoing incidents that are sent to every network affected firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks firms signing up for the sensing system include mci bt deutsche telekom energis ntt bell canada and many others the creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by us firm arbor networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites launch worms and relay spam around the net we have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic said rob pollard sales director for arbor networks which is behind the fingerprinting system attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination he said once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem mr pollard said arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected what we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source said mr pollard arbor network s technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net based attack of some kind this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated said malcolm seagrave security expert at energis in the last months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we ve seen massive growth he said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks

court mulls file sharing future judges at the us supreme court have been hearing evidence for and against file sharing networks the court will decide whether producers of file sharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file sharers could deter innovation they also said that file trading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy the lawsuit brought by of the world s largest entertainment firms has raged for several years legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file trading firms into bankruptcy but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus the file sharers at the centre of the case are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file sharing providers instead they would have to pursue individuals who use peer to peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies the hi tech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue intel filed a document with the supreme court earlier this month in defence of grokster and others despite misgivings about some aspects of the file sharing community it summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products are essentially tools that like any other tools capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes asking firms to second guess the uses that its technologies would be put to and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use would stifle innovation it said the electronic frontier foundation a civil rights watchdog is also defending streamcast networks the company behind the morpheus file sharing software the case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation it said it cites as do many the landmark ruling in which found that sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its betamax video recorder could be used for piracy defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peer to peer networks upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case a small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered wearing save betamax t shirts the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past years said gary shapiro chief executive of the consumer electronics association supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apple s ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had on balance been beneficial to society he said that while file trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music conceptually the technology had some really excellent uses based on tuesday s hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but file sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy grokster s lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up but this argument was dismissed as ridiculous by justice david souter cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year it s about preserving america s proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology he said the case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peer to peer networks they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs file sharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software government documents and promotional copies of music

mobile multimedia slow to catch on there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of according to analysts gartner more than million handsets were sold globally between july and september a period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps sounds and video clips few so far are taking the chance to do so in fact the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures audio and video is growing figures gathered by continental research shows that of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message mms up from in this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to million getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets also he said they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to according to continental research of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation only regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people s reluctance to start sending them said mr jain they ask themselves if i m streaming video from one handset to another will it work he said there s a lot of user apprehension about that there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant he said the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users no one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped said mr bud this has led to operators finding other technologies particularly one known as wap push to get multimedia to their customers but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers the results can be dramatic israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india the largest mobile firm in the country the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems while not multimedia messaging such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content as a result of the subscribers to the hutch alive which uses celltick s broadcast technology regularly click for more pictures sounds and images from the operator operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers said yaron toren spokesman for celltick until then multimedia will be a message that is not getting through

peer to peer nets here to stay peer to peer pp networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts once several high profile legal cases against file sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from pp technology the expert panel probed the future of pp at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january the first convictions for pp piracy were handed out in the us in january william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software since the first successful file sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of pp technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy but that is going to change very soon according to the panel the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate pp networks which are not illegal in themselves and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks but they have slowly realised that pp is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of pp network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy protection standards but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with pp cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media when they ca n t stop it they try to control it then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business in august the san francisco based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file sharing networks the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the s vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal pp networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files instead it uses direct connections between computers or clients there are now many different types of pp systems than work in different ways pp nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use pp technology to distribute them the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many the global entertainment industry says more than billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file sharers away from free content sales of legally downloaded songs grew tenfold in with million tracks bought online in the us and europe in months the ifpi reported this week but such download services are very different from pp networks not least because of the financial aspect there are several money spinning models that could turn pp into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies paid for pass along in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser based options are all being considered we see there are going to be different models for commoditising pp said marc morgenstern vice president of anti piracy firm overpeer consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and pp technology by continuing to use it for their own creations unsigned bands for example use pp networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign increasingly what you are seeing on pp is consumer created content said derek broes from microsoft they will probably play an increasing role in helping pp spread he said looking into pp s future file sharing is just the beginning for pp networks as far as mr broes is concerned once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said file sharing is the tip of the iceberg

tv s future down the phone line internet tv has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now but any early attempts to do it the uk s home choice started in were thwarted by the lack of a fast network now that broadband networks are bedding down and it is becoming essential for millions the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls they are keen to be the top iptv dogs software giant microsoft thinks iptv internet protocol tv is the future of television and it sits neatly with its vision of the connected entertainment experience telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time ed graczyk director of marketing for microsoft iptv told the bbc news website the challenge has been the broadband network and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution compression technology was not efficient enough the net was not good enough a lot of stars have aligned in the last months to make it a reality last year he said was all about deal making and partnering up shaping the iptv ecosystem this year those deals will start to play out and more services will come online is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america and other parts of asia it will expand he added what telcos really want to do is to send the triple play of video voice and data down one single line be it cable or dsl digital subscriber line some are talking about quadruple play too with mobile services added into the mix it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators according to technology analysts tdg research there will be million subscribers to iptv services in under six years key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data whenever a viewer wants it is that it uses the same technology as the internet it means there is not just a one way relationship between the viewer and the broadcaster this allows for more dvd like interactivity limitless storage and broadcast space bespoke channel playlists and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer s fingertips it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller niche or localised audiences sending films to bollywood fans for instance as well as individual devices operators could also send high definition programmes straight to the viewer bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver perhaps most compelling yet some might say insignificant is instantaneous channel flicking currently there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite cable or freeview with iptv the speed is milliseconds that gets rounds of applause according to mr graczyk microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future but that is several years away said mr graczyk as with music tv has moved to digital formats the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv to the mobile to the gaming console and so on the company intends its microsoft s iptv edition software an end to end management and delivery platform to let telcos to do exactly that seamlessly it has netted seven major telcos as customers representing a potential audience of million existing broadband subscribers its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date said mr graczyk iptv is about more than telcos though there are several web based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net s power jeremy allaire chief of brightcove told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a channel it is not just niches but about exploiting content not usually viewed he said we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content and who often see unencumbered distribution for them to do it through cable and so on is price prohibitive he said this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators history channel archives for instance what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field there are a lot of other middleware players providing similar management services as microsoft like myrio and c cor but it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful
