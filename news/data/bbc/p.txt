hewitt decries career sexism plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in labour s election manifesto the trade and industry secretary has said patricia hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated but it was an increasingly high priority and a shared goal across government ms hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission eoc mothers can currently take up to six months paid leave and six unpaid ms hewitt told the seminar clearly one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months we are looking at how quickly we can do that because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that ms hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and taster courses for men and women in non traditional jobs women in full time work earn less than men according to the equal opportunities commission eoc the minister told delegates that getting rid of career sexism was vital to closing the gender pay gap career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential it is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex she said earlier she told bbc radio s today programme what we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of women work in jobs that are low paid and typically dominated by women so we have got very segregated employment unfortunately in some cases this reflects very old fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women or indeed for men career sexism is about saying that engineering for instance where only of employees are women is really a male dominated industry construction is even worse but it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men career sexism goes both ways she added that while progress had been made there was still a gap in pay figures the average woman working full time is being paid about p for every pound a man is earning for women working part time it is p the department for trade and industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the tuc it has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies research conducted by the eoc last year revealed that many britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of natural differences between the sexes women hold less than of the top positions in ftse companies the police the judiciary and trade unions according to their figures and retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average

drink remark acts as diversion the first minister s statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed jack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnell s comment was ill advised the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems mr law said scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions the one sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill advised remark by the first minister if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage mr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotland s fight against binge drinking he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink mr law added i think the remark was ill advised but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland we do n t want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him he added here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his ill judged comment and withdraw it immediately in a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context he told ms sturgeon it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i should encourage young people to get drunk that is completely untrue perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with all for the sake of a simple soundbite
concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england s secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report the government s response to the plan for a four tier diploma to replace all existing qualifications is expected next week some are worried it could be scuppered if as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested gcses and a levels stay sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half hearted response said the chairman of the commons education select committee labour mp barry sheerman his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma but only to replace existing vocational qualifications we must tackle head on the structural mess that is our secondary education system he wrote in the times educational supplement it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak the qualifications and curriculum authority qca has also told the government not to compromise the qca said the potential step change in participation and attainment lay in the integrity of the whole diploma any partial implementation of the proposals would in our view compromise that integrity said its chairman sir anthony greener it is a sign of the qca s concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills they may be content if it does not close too many doors in writing whatever spin is put on it the chief inspector of schools david bell also said recently that gcses and a levels should go one of the reasons why i m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system he said if we do n t say this is a sea change in education we will miss a great opportunity universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers organisation the cbi which complains of a lack of skills in an attempt to address this the tomlinson plan is for tests in functional maths and literacy decidedly not gcses it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms concerns on this score another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson s predecessor as chief schools inspector professor chris woodhead who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top a level grade no matter how well the others have done

butler launches attack on blair former civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blair s government operates accusing it of being obsessed with headlines he also attacked the way the iraq war was sold to the public with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the most damaging testimony he could remember but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions the prime minister s official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues but he added you cannot in a modern government take every decision in cabinet it s just not possible lord butler said the government had too much freedom to bring in bad bills and to do whatever it likes and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine i would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling there is too much central control and there is too little of what i would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments mr howard described lord butler s intervention as very important this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government it is certainly the most damaging testimony i can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position lord butler s report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the government s september weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was very thin the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers case for war lord butler said in his spectator interview which was conducted by the magazine s editor conservative mp boris johnson he said when civil servants give material to ministers they say these are the conclusions we ve drawn but we ve got to tell you the evidence we ve got is pretty thin similarly if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was a very serious threat when asked whether he thought the country was well governed on the whole he replied well i think we are a country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive and that is a very grave flaw we should be breaking away from the party whip the executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad bills a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow all that is part of what is bad government in this country lord butler s assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary lord armstrong lord armstrong told bbc two s newsnight i agree there does n t appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butler s comments were well justified and mr blair s style of leadership was corrosive of the whole system of government but labour former minister jack cunningham accused lord butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming labour administration when he was cabinet secretary mr cunningham told bbc radio s today programme taken together robin butler s comments are partial inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the labour government

labour targets hardcore truants a fresh crackdown on persistent truants in england has been launched by education secretary ruth kelly serial truants make up one in pupils previous initiatives brought pupils back to school since according to official statistics parenting contracts penalty notices and fast track prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem it is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day tories say labour s previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence where parents are permitted to take children out of school such absences are often due to family holidays however serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing m those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term in one local education authority alone parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child s attendance improved the tough stance paid off with just issued while attendance improved in cases truancy has been reduced by at the worst hit schools through the government s behaviour improvement programme this is the equivalent of pupils back in classes since september the new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps the sixth of which will take place on monday police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school held twice each year in addition to routine local patrols previous country wide sweeps have apprehended pupils dodging school in almost of those cases the youngsters were accompanied by their parents a department for education and skills source said every day in school counts it is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation s truancy
blunkett sorry over murder plan david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced prematurely via press release a review of murder laws the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as a mess he said the review would look at partial defences to murder including provocation and at mandatory sentences the home office has already said the review will begin next year on wednesday a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday but the announcement never came with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage amid opposition anger mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his gracious apology and the review itself but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be dragged to face mps in its report the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be graded to recognise the seriousness of the offence but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility the commission an independent body including two judges a senior barrister and sentencing experts had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law results of a consultation exercise showed respondents out of among them judges believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was indefensible and should cease a key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence but speaking after the report was published home office minister baroness scotland said murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence where an offender is convicted of murder the court must pass a life sentence the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife

student fee factor played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland however lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out applications from england and wales rose by between january and the previous year up to fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid top up fees of up to a year being introduced in england in june last year mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by in an attempt to prevent a cross border flood although no figure has yet been agreed legislation to introduce the top up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas universities scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out director david caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities but this was not a major factor he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study they know that when they take up their studies in they will be hit by top up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated however it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge an additional figure of about also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales where there are no plans for top up fees have also risen by mr wallace said accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held not just in britain we want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students
anglers could face prosecution anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty a committee of mps has warned sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended the environment select committee said the mps said they were concerned the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved mps said they called for a cast iron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up a duty of care in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing mutilation of animals unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal s best interest the environment select committee made recommendations after hearing evidence from organisations and individuals one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged even if they were to later fail we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government s intention to exempt fishing as an activity but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought however in exempting fishing the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given carte blanche to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity the committee added the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill such as the law on abandonment of animals which would be significantly weakened mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect or unnecessary mental suffering to go unpunished committee chairman michael jack said any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest this draft bill is no exception my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which does n t just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place but mr jack said the bill very much had the feel of a work in progress and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs circuses and game bird farms the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament he added

mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system mps have said the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access courts should be used as a last resort but where they are their orders should be enforced more rigorously mps said but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount an arbitrary template imposed on all families whatever the needs of the child would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position the mps said they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non resident parent in contested cases this would reassert the rights of non resident parents to contact with their children as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety they said delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed a new status quo arrangement for the children to become established by default they said although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias there are considerable grounds for accepting that non resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents committee chairman alan beith said the five month inquiry had been a complex and emotive one at the moment far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation he said this situation has to change the court system should only be used as a last resort where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country

kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a zero tolerance drive education secretary ruth kelly has suggested ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems the minister also confirmed she received spiritual support from the catholic movement opus dei but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run up to the next general election ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight she told bbc one s breakfast with frost it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school who sexually abuse pupils or other people who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett her links to opus dei which means work of god in latin have provoked controversy critics say the organisation which adheres strictly to catholic teachings is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims asked if she was a member of the group ms kelly said i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right but those are private spiritual matters and i m sure you ll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas she argued the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and a levels her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place he said she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how this is an all talk agenda that lets down children teachers and parents

eu china arms ban to be lifted the eu embargo on arms exports to china is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite us objections uk foreign secretary jack straw has said the year old ban was imposed in the aftermath of china s crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square mr straw told a commons select committee human rights concerns over china remained but he said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma in december the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet the eu s move was welcomed at the time by beijing which described the embargo as a product of the cold war german chancellor gerhard schroeder and french president jacques chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted britain has been more cautious on the issue but on wednesday mr straw said he also wanted it to end i have long understood china s argument that to lump them in with say burma and zimbabwe is not appropriate and i do n t think it is he told the joint committee on strategic export controls he said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before britain takes over the presidency of the eu from luxembourg in july but he said an eu code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country if it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to china as we have now mr straw said the us government was suspicious of the motives of some other countries within the eu in wanting the ban lifted but he said many of washington s objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in eu countries and intense discussions were taking place with us officials to convince them it was the right thing to do washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by china to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan us officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the eu code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses us undersecretary of state john bolton is meeting british officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo
debate needed on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning there were almost m in reported donations to political parties in and with nearly m of them from individual gifts worth more than m the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report if there was to be a cap it should be a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned m in donations between and even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from m to m the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll as happens with other elections electoral commission chairman sam younger said there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system

muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives the event is being held by the muslim association of britain mab which believes muslim voters could influence the result in up to constituencies last year mab which opposed the war in iraq urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections but a spokesman stressed the meeting was not necessarily anti labour this meeting is not anti party in particular it s anti policy it s on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday s event there are issues of concern to muslims and muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq the palestinian situation the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic social and education problems approximately m of the uk s m muslims are of voting age previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason with many saying it was unjustified representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesday s event among them will be the muslim council of britain mcb the chairman of the mcb s public affairs committee sher khan said the war in iraq would be a significant factor affecting muslims voting intentions i think it s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact mr khan said however professor john curtice of the university of strathclyde is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make for the most part the labour constituencies where there s a large muslim community are relatively safe but there are one or two that are not quite so safe professor curtice said the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green in east london and rochdale in lancashire he added in bethnal green former labour mp george galloway who founded the anti war party respect is standing against sitting mp oona king who had a vote majority in in rochdale the liberal democrats the mainstream party a icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour secured second place in the election securing just under votes fewer than labour s lorna fitzsimons but professor curtice said the muslim anti war vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats which is generally the case he said but dr tamimi said mab s intention was not to empower the tories we know the next government will be labour but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly if the next labour government has a reduced majority that s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country dr tamimi said

opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed serious misgivings about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest michael howard said he would not back the home secretary s plans for control orders which include home detention i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician he said the lib dems also oppose the proposals but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders saying i m sorry it is a dilemma but there is only one choice but mr howard said we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison not at home while they await trial mr howard said he feared internment without trial creates martyrs and could be a very effective recruiting sergeant for terrorists his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court he called on the prime minister to enter into constructive discussions with his party to find a better way forward controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december was freed from jail home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man known only as c certified as a terrorist suspect on monday the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio s today programme it s a matter of principle for us that we ca n t have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions we think there could be a role for some form of control order tagging surveillance limitation on use of mobile phones but not with the home secretary s say so that must be done with a proper judicial process a judge involved in making those decisions said mr oaten mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk he said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in serious cases with independent scrutiny from judges
visa decision every minutes visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every minutes mps have said pressure was placed on staff to be efficient rather than to do a thorough examination of an application the public accounts committee found every officer had an annual target of applications equivalent to a day or one every minutes mps want research into whether uk visa holders leave at the end of their stays or vanish into the black market committee chairman edward leigh said there is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents the committee s report also discussed the romanian and bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister beverley hughes last year committee members said the home office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused investigations carried out in the wake of ms hughes resignation found more than people had entered the uk under the business visa scheme for romanian and bulgarian entrepreneurs mr leigh said the home office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business a home office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation he added that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre entry applications will be replaced by a single pre entry check at post which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system

no to royal succession shake up a labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the royal family the same rights as males the legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the crown it would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics but the government refused to back lord dubs succession to the crown bill saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues the lord chancellor lord falconer agreed the act of settlement which governs the succession was discriminatory but added that for all practical purposes its effects are limited the changes proposed by lord dubs were a complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues he said lord falconer said there were members of the royal family in the line of succession after the prince of wales all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act it is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly while we wish to remove all forms of discrimination this is n t the proper form he added he did not rule out change in the future but said if lord dubs private member s bill was passed by peers he would urge mps to oppose it in the commons lord dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the house of lords but urged the government to think again at a later stage we cannot forever say we do n t want to change things because it is too difficult he told peers during the debate the labour peer and former minister said the monarchy should symbolise the values of this country what we do n t want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times we are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against catholics but opponents of the bill including tory lord campbell of alloway and the bishop of winchester the rt rev michael scott joynt said it would separate the state from both the church of england and the christian faith such a secular state would be markedly less tolerant rt rev scott joynt argued

report attacks defence spending the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects a national audit office report on the biggest projects says costs have risen by bn in the past year it says there is little evidence the mod s performance had improved despite the introduction of a smart acquisition policy six years ago a senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned the nao s annual report showed the total cost of the projects covered was expected to reach bn higher than originally planned the total delays amounted to months with average individual delays rising by three months sir john bourn head of the nao said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase the report says the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older legacy projects such as the eurofighter a senior defence official speaking to the bbc s defence correspondent paul adams said that although the figures were still not good enough the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle this year s overspend was significantly less than last year s bn total and the defence procurement agency which is responsible for buying defence equipment was improving lord bach minister for defence procurement said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown but insisted that the defence procurement agency had undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects the latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last months and according to our correspondent contain few new surprises turning around the defence procurement agency was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker it takes a very long time indeed he said our correspondent said it was the same projects including the joint strike fighter the nimrod and am aircraft and the type destroyer which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over runs and delay but he added some projects such as the c heavy lift aircraft and successor identification friend or foe siff were showing good performances

asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania the trial scheme which could start in weeks may be extended to apply to children from other countries children s charities have reacted with alarm saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected but the home office says it may be in the children s best interests if it reunites them with their communities the pilot included in the government s five year immigration plan aims to return unaccompanied asylum seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims since at least under s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members these children automatically become the responsibility of social services up to now ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at at least a dozen albanian born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return according to sources although there is no public confirmation of numbers those selected could either be returned to their families should they be traced or placed in the care of other albanian authorities separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country under the children act public bodies have a duty to act in the best interest of a child in their care laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns not least because of the well documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis she said we do not think there are structures in place to receive returning children in albania if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision in its five year immigration plan announced on tuesday the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused said the spokesman we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable we do not believe that it is right or in keeping with children s legislation that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned he said but andrew hogg spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies from what is so far known we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account said mr hogg in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure the medical foundation has many serious concerns including the assessment process for suitability for return the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries
fido to be taken off vote lists the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote the uk elections watchdog has said those are some of the mistakes found under the current system where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud voters need to register by march if the next poll is on may as expected but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual identifiers when they vote such as their own voting number date of birth and signature the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll the mps heard and some people have registered all their family regardless of their age birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check non british citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at hard to reach voters for example some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out mr younger said using the royal mail s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about voters he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form he said it might also help register students in halls of residences where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody the mps on the office of the deputy prime minister and constitutional affairs select committees pressed mr younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover he said the northern ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted currently british voters have to re register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running mr younger suggested the re registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up to date

howard backs stem cell research michael howard has backed stem cell research saying it is important people are not frightened of the future the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election where george bush opposed extending it but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimer s parkinson s and motor neurone disease i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses he said the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body s tissue types scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney heart or even brain tissue mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research but he argued we must n t be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past we must be optimistic about the future politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind with the life expectancy of the average briton now around the mid s society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people s lives as they grow older i know many people are concerned about stem cell research they are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls i respect those concerns but i also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like parkinson s multiple sclerosis motor neurone disease alzheimer s and as we saw in the papers today now possibly heart problems mr howard acknowledged there were no easy answers over such an issue but it was necessary to have the courage to do what we know to be morally right he added of course stem cells are still a recent discovery more research needs to be done but we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown up way the hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved former superman actor the late christopher reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident mr howard made his remarks during a speech in westminster to the conservative national women s committee on ambitions and values
howard unveils tory asylum plans tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees michael howard has said as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas some charities say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans by cutting the number of front line immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set in a speech in london on monday mr howard said it s not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that firm but fair immigration controls were essential for good community relations withdrawing from the united nations convention on refugees which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need not numbers introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk a worry for national security stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk mr howard said nearly people were settling in the uk every year the size of a city like peterborough the plans would help achieve a substantial reduction in immigration he said although he could not predict a figure he said that only two out of asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current unfair and inhumane system we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum mr howard said by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans dangerous ill thought out and hugely irresponsible lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled she warned commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down and economic migration down about he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture mr howard called that suggestion disgraceful
campaign cold calls questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people s voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioner s office says surveys are allowed but there is a grey area if personal data is kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run up to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law a spokesman for the information commissioner s office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics not person by person if a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing he said the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future the spokesman said there was no yes or no answer and the area was pretty grey he added if someone complained then we would investigate that political parties are aware of the regulations at the last by elections we reminded them lib dem chairman matthew taylor has now written to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them
tory leader quits legal position david mcletchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role the scottish conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with tods murray did not influence the causes he supports but on friday he said i have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect mr mcletchie had received advice from holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare labour said he had cleverly not asked about paid advocacy a tory spokesman totally refuted any wrongdoing mr mcletchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport the msp had been a partner for tods murray which has a client opposing the development mr mcletchie did not have a complaint made against him but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong explaining his reason for quitting the post mr mcletchie said i have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with tods murray however i have no wish to see a similar situation arise again to avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of tods murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled i have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year i am proud to have been a part of tods murray for the last years and wish it well in the future labour msp christine may had said mr mcletchie was very clever to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section of the code he was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section the section on paid advocacy she said section of the members interest order legally obliges msps to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner however msps code of conduct recognises a wider definition of parliamentary proceedings including a non statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices such as motions but a letter from holyrood s chamber office chief ken hughes also made clear that mr mcletchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor commenting on mr mcletchie s decision to stand down a scottish labour party spokesman said this should mean mr mcletchie does n t breach the paid advocacy rules in future however it does n t change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past scottish national party holyrood leader nicola sturgeon accused mr mcletchie of failing to properly serve his constituents ms sturgeon said i think this whole episode has been very damaging for mr mcletchie and i m sure he will be reflecting on it she added that she thought that the tories were an irrelevant party so she would not lose any sleep over it peter misselbrook executive partner of tods murray said mr mcletchie had been considering retirement later in the year he added david has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so

uk plan to deport terror suspects deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of men at belmarsh prison london and woodhill milton keynes was unlawful the affected by the ruling are from algeria tunisia egypt and jordan the government was told that using anti terror legislation brought in after september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws mr clarke told the times i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw in a very positive way mr clarke said that he was seeking memorandums of understanding between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return however he added i do not think the solution to the law lords judgement for this government is in deportations but they will help there are other strands that we have to do but the liberal democrat s shadow home secretary mark oaten accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future he told bbc news and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing for example intercept communications telephone tapping to be included mr oaten said deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country unless we get that the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march the bbc s home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor david blunkett but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees home countries could be difficult some of these people are accused of very very serious crimes in their home countries so it s not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it wo n t be the solution daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process in the next few weeks the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial he said

council tax rise reasonable welsh councils should set their taxes at reasonable levels after being given an average funding increase of says the assembly government finance minister sue essex said it was a good deal for local government the bn settlement includes the full m from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises in addition m will come from the business support grant a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates she said where spending rises were kept to around she was confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels the welsh local government association wlga had said on the eve of the announcement said that significant cuts to services may still be unavoidable after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington of torfaen said it was vital that rises were minimsed a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems said mr wellington it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase on monday a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds ms essex said i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels even for those people who have moved up a band the settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a rise in capital expenditure support ms essex said this is a good deal for local government which will allow the well managed councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level plaid cymru s local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement hugely disappointing he said wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims it is anger this will mean either a massive hike in council tax massive cuts in services provided by councils or both mike german leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding mr german said i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum but the random redistribution effect of rebanding will create a great deal of difficulty conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change is taking spin to the very verge of deception he added around a third of welsh households have been re valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures
blunkett row should end blair prime minister tony blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding david blunkett the tories and the lib dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast tracking of a visa application for mr blunkett s ex lover s nanny sir alan budd found a chain of events linked mr blunkett to leoncia casalme s indefinite leave to remain application at the end of his middle east trip mr blair said he still admired mr blunkett and thought his integrity was intact on tuesday sir alan said the application for leave to remain in the uk made by kimberly quinn s nanny was processed in days days faster than the average but he could not find evidence to show whether mr blunkett s intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover s nanny or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance in his first comments since sir alan s announcement mr blair told bbc news he had not yet read the report in detail but told bbc news as far as i m concerned we have drawn a line under that asked if mr blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point he replied i have made my admiration for david very clear and it remains he s been a tremendous colleague he s done a great job for us first as home secretary then as education secretary the future is something we will have to approach in the future the prime minister shrugged off claims from conservative leader michael howard that he led a grubby government he said mr blunkett s integrity remained intact he was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up he accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened he said but i think sir alan budd also accepted there was n t some conspiracy or cover up and i just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on earlier mr howard said there does need to be another inquiry a judge led inquiry there were so many questions that were n t answered there was deceit at the heart of government which was not limited to the visa affair he argued lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten also said there was a strong case for a judge led judicial review he said next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa it may be about something even more important than that mr blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of sir alan s findings in a statement the ex home secretary said he accepted the inquiry s findings he said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system

brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour s next general election bid he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs s creation the chancellor has previously planned the party s election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn a key ally of tony blair the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour s campaign and praised his handling of the economy writing in the guardian newspaper mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear labour s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment not just attacking ignorance disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education good health and sustainable communities bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown s article was a warning shot to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process it was as always coded and careful but entirely deliberate was mr marr s assessment the prime minister was asked about mr brown s article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio s today programme mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor s role would be central mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of mr brown s management of the economy and he pledged childcare would be a centrepiece of labour s manifesto he also predicted the next general election will be a tough tough fight for new labour but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about may mr blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour s majority instead of hoping for an outright win

uk firms embracing e commerce uk firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before e commerce minister mike o brien says a government commissioned study ranked the uk third in its world index of use of information and communication technology ict the report suggests of uk firms are now using broadband and that of micro businesses are trading online mr o brien said uk businesses were sprinting forward in ict use but that there were more challenges ahead the report carried out independently by consultants booz allen hamilton and hi europe placed the uk third behind sweden and ireland for business use of ict it showed british business brought greater maturity to their ict use by using broadband in increased numbers bringing ict into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences mr o brien said the increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that uk companies are embracing the opportunities that ict can bring it is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years the government would play its part in cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish mr o brien said the clear message the report sends is that effective use of ict can bring real improvements in business performance for all business however we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the uk is to reach its aim of becoming a world leading e economy he added the international benchmarking study was based on telephone interviews with businesses of which more than were uk businesses it is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ict in the world s most industrialised nations
uk heading wrong way howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message mr blair s government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded britain is working do n t let the tories wreck it again mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice worst of all it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes we can have progress without losing what makes britain great its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential we simply need to change direction the election will give britain the chance to change this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account but labour spokesman mr kemp said it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on april not january let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax with labour britain is working rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country
kilroy launches veritas party ex bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy silk has said he wants to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party mr kilroy silk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas latin for truth would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk mr kilroy silk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon s ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip s two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukip s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left mr kilroy silk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june s european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy silk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroy silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroy silk has gone now ukip at least has a chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country kilroy silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroy silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party it s all flash and no real policy here let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of veritas symbolises that

minister defends hunting ban law the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and very clear alun michael has said the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law which came into force on friday and pretended they were not some hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of foxes only four were accidentally killed by hounds but anti hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting people had turned out to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed legally as far as he was aware although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence exercising hounds chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable mr michael told bbc radio s today programme there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting the reality is that the law is very clear you ca n t chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer if people do so and pretend they re not it s going to become very clear you ca n t hunt accidentally mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy the health service and their children s future than hunting but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen thousands of hunt supporters turned out at hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban with anti hunt groups sending out monitors to check the law was not being broken there were only four arrests over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws but penny little who monitored the bicester hunt in oxfordshire said she had witnessed gratuitous spiteful killing of foxes if people tried to run circles around this law the only outcome would be that it was tightened up she said mike hobday from the league against cruel sports said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police he said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti hunt activists videoing hunts but mr jackson who had been at the bicester hunt in oxfordshire denied there was any intimidation

lawyer attacks anti terror laws a senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government s anti terror laws says the current system is giving britain a bad name ian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful he was part of a strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign mr macdonald told bbc news the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion the current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the muslim community in britain and the whole asian community i think it is giving britain a bad name internationally under the anti terrorism crime and security act introduced by the government in in response to the september attacks foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury my own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury a proper criminal trial with proper accusations as far as i m concerned the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this he added the attorney general lord goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from mr macdonald on monday according to the independent his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers nicholas blake qc andrew nicol qc manjit singh gill qc rick scannell and tom de la mare they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission siac a secure court without a jury which tries terror suspects mr macdonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow but barry hugill a spokesman for the campaign group liberty told radio s today programme that more lawyers may go i can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning he said they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in the right to trial by jury has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights helena kennedy a labour peer and a human rights lawyer said the special advocates main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees when this whole procedure was being considered immediately after september there was a great deal of argument particularly in the house of lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review she said without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot as ian mcdonald has said on our legal landscape something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law

housing plans criticised by mps irreversible environmental damage will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south east england mps have warned sustainable communities were being promoted without a real understanding of what sustainable means the environmental audit committee said it said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed deputy prime minister john prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced he said we are working across government especially with our colleagues at defra to create cleaner safer and greener communities while protecting and enhancing the environment the report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues including water even though supplies in parts of the south east are already too low regulations designed to ensure energy efficient buildings are too lax and builders routinely flout them anyway it said financing for improving transport was around one twentieth of what would be required the report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially john prescott s department bbc environment correspondent richard black said chairman of the environmental audit committee peter ainsworth mp said the government s housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined up policy is crucial i accept the need to improve housing supply but as things stand the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser points raised in the report included no proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence the government should recognise shortcomings of the treasury s barker review which said new homes a year were needed in britain the government should consider a national spatial framework for england such as those already in place in scotland and wales the office of the deputy prime minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero emissions homes the government should make clear how it intends to measure its success at creating sustainable communities conservative local government spokeswoman caroline spelman said there is now growing evidence that john prescott s buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural england
mps murder sentence concern murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new mps report the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor at present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff the minimum term they must serve if the defendant pleads guilty but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy in july this year amanda champion s killer james ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least years it would have been longer had he denied the charge amanda s uncle lewis champion told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing last minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill as a result says the committee the government may need to re legislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales lord woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty the committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers lord woolf s sentencing guidelines council sgc caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime as a result murderers who face a year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliament s wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence he said we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals he said by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government s claim to be tough on crime he said but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different he told bbc news
no one can define new hunt ban the new law banning hunting with dogs is so poorly drafted no one can define the offence pro hunt mps say the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to chase away unwanted animals from his farm because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting chasing away and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group of which mr opik is a co chairman after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry defra he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence prompting him to complain the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defra s lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act therefore you would not be committing an offence mr opik said hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting chasing away which is n t even covered by the act however all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting exempt hunting drag hunting unintentional hunting a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away tory mp peter luff another co chairman of middle way said that the legislation was so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law however i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating mike hobday of the league against cruel sports said there is no confusion it is a matter of simple common sense if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer then nobody can define that as hunting

ministers lose slopping out case the scottish executive has lost an appeal against an inmate s compensation for being forced to slop out in prison armed robber robert napier won after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint eczema when slopping out at barlinnie prison napier said that the practice where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets breached his human rights on thursday the court of session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof the executive faces more than similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates more than actions have already been raised in the court of session and sheriff courts in scotland an executive spokesman said we will study this judgement in detail much has changed to address the issues raised in the napier case for example slopping out has ended at barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated today s judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases napier a remand prisoner at the time raised a legal challenge in under the european convention on human rights in which he sought he was awarded compensation last april after winning his case executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the european convention on human rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should be beyond reasonable doubt this is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in scotland however civil litigation is settled on the test of a balance of probabilities judge lord cullen sitting with lord osborne and lord hamilton ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard napier s lawyer tony kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others mr kelly said there are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by today s judgement scottish national party justice minister kenny macaskill said that the slopping out case had been a fiasco from start to finish he said ministers were fully aware of the state of scotland s jails funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling i suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts a short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost
escaped prisoner report ordered first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded michael ferguson escaped after being allowed out of the high security carstairs unit the snp s nicola sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report ministerial responsibility for carstairs rests with rhona brankin the deputy health minister ms brankin said the first minister has called for a review of what has happened we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this ms sturgeon has written to mr mcconnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out she said questions must be answered about his escape if the public is to be reassured about safety police are still searching for ferguson who failed to return after a trip to east kilbride on monday the scottish national party s parliamentary leader argued that under the law authorisation of ferguson s leave of absence would have come directly from ministers she said the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs however my understanding is that under the mental health legislation the decision to grant this patient and any restricted patient leave of absence would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers she added i have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact i have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on this is not an attempt to apportion blame but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases police said ferguson posed a danger to the public bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation he said we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised scottish conservative leader david mcletchie said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers she said ministers were told of that notified of it but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off they do have statutory responsibility but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision ferguson who slashed a man in a doctors surgery in coatbridge in had been out to see his fianc e annabella holmes whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire he is described as being ft ins tall slim with blond hair blue eyes and a fair complexion ferguson was wearing a black jacket grey jeans black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen he has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye ms holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of ferguson since monday strathclyde police asked anyone who spots ferguson to contact sergeant keith mcdonald on

councils must find gypsy sites ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks said housing minister yvette cooper in november mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because travellers have no place to stop ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places that scheme has paid out m in four years with m available for there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper firstly local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites and secondly they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short term because of risk to local amenity and the environment under the new regulations expected to be in force in the spring officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban many mps with rural constituencies particularly in eastern england have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers as they often do living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals legal action and eviction is no one s idea of fun in their november report mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister responsible for housing said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities said the mps in turn the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents two of the most controversial traveller sites cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle

falconer rebuts charade claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia through the back door were not a political ploy the lord chancellor has said ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment including food and fluids tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland it is important we do n t end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen he said on tuesday the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by votes to despite rebellion by labour mps the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark eventually he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes prompting claims of a shambles the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords he told bbc news we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life the motive has got to be to end suffering he denied the concessions were a political manoeuvre forced by panic about the rebellion it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a sensible solution he said i do n t think it is something to be embarrassed about these issues are not easy to deal with he went on bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast after his performance but lord falconer praised his minister for an excellent job former conservative leader iain duncan smith one of the chief critics of the plans condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague

new foot and mouth action urged a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defra s lackadaisical approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks but mr leigh said the department was dragging its heels that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry he also said defra had been dreadfully slow in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis the outbreak which began in led to the slaughter of million animals devastated many farms and rural businesses and is estimated to have cost the uk up to bn four years after the outbreak defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors costs and m of invoices remain unpaid mr leigh said mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis ministers had hoped to get m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted m that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between two and three times the commission s assessment of their likely market value national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at on the issue of the unpaid invoices sir john said defra had paid of the bn submitted by contractors since but has not agreed a final settlement with contractors pending the results of its investigations mr leigh said being better prepared would also help avoid the need for mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the outbreak a defra spokesman said we welcome the report it acknowledges the progress the department has made since particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak however the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable
correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments the national correctional agency would have provided a one stop justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition instead scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending scotland s reoffending rate is high with more than of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail this is leading to an ever expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem ministers thought merging the prison service with the council controlled criminal justice social work departments which provide community sentences might have provided an answer however following a consultation on the idea justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans instead ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps s role and performance in reducing reoffending the minister said better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there communities who are paying the price for this reoffending both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs expect better it costs the taxpayer a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison therefore as we continue to invest in the service it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves to ministers and to parliament

top judge clashes with ministers the uk s top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen lord woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence but he told mps the lord chancellor lord falconer was insisting he should have the final say in such cases lord hutton s inquiry into the death of dr david kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries the government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against lord woolf s wishes lord woolf who is lord chief justice of england and wales was giving evidence to the commons public administration select committee s inquiry into public inquiries he said he had not been involved in the choice of lord hutton who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction but he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so which judge it should be in written evidence to the committee lord woolf said i have so far failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue i intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue such as the intelligence on iraq s weapons of mass destruction he said he argued the subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved in addition the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed the judiciary as a result of the appointment may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government he told the mps anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me lord woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns but that situation could change with new legal reforms the issue had been overlooked when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions what i am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement on appointing a judge it does n t happen he said lord woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle a department for constitutional affairs spokeswoman said lord woolf and lord falconer agreed about what happened in practice their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence a very narrow dispute in lord woolf s words she said as lord woolf also acknowledged it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries

custody death rate shocks mps deaths in custody have reached shocking levels a committee of mps and peers has warned the joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable with mental health drugs or alcohol problems members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons police cells detention centres and special hospitals there was one prison suicide every four days between and mps said the report which followed a year long inquiry by the committee found the high death rate amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group many of those who ended up taking their own lives had presented themselves to the authorities with these problems before they even offended the report said it questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term the report said committee chairman labour mp jean corston said each and every death in custody is a death too many regardless of the circumstances yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives these highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly ill suited to meet even their basic needs crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before the misplaced over reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under article of the european convention on human rights and meet our duty of care to them the committee also highlighted deeply worrying cases of children and young people taking their own lives between and children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres it picked out the case of joseph scholes who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in stoke heath young offender institution in march and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry it revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies the year old was depressed exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about times even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness he was sentenced to a two year detention and training order nine days into his sentence joseph hung himself from the bars of his cell window with a sheet
new rules tackle sham weddings new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force from tuesday most non eu citizens will need home office approval to marry the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages of which there are estimated to be up to a year but immigrants group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants jcwi says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge when the changes were unveiled last year immigration minister des browne said our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages while providing firm controls to prevent abuse under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give days notice of the wedding at the local register office but from tuesday all non eu nationals apart from citizens of switzerland liechtenstein iceland or norway intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office certificate of marriage approval to get a certificate costing applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk those without a settled status such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application will have no right to marry in the uk once they have the necessary documentation those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of specially designated register offices they can however marry at the register office or church of their choice rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were not proportionate and discriminatory these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort we re currently taking a legal opinion on this we ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we ll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court ms beynon said the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights in a report published last july the cross party committee stated there was a significant risk the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were disproportionate the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion belief and nationality the report added over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions in january people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of years and last november samuel amoah a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk was jailed for three years several other cases are currently going through the courts the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office has been key in many prosecutions registrars spokesman mark rimmer said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases certainly those who are illegals in this country of which we had quite a few will no longer be getting married mr rimmer said mr rimmer the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north west london said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it s still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry for example in holland germany or france i think it s a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem mr rimmer said
ministers naive over phone taps the government is being naive by refusing to allow phone tap evidence in court a senior eu politician says javier solana eu foreign policy chief says phone tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries human rights groups top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases mr solana told itv s jonathan dimbleby programme phone tap evidence in court works it is normal that it is done it would be naive not to do it it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal mr solana s comments come the day after sir ian blair the newly appointed metropolitan police commissioner said he was in favour of phone tap evidence under the anti terrorism crimes and security act foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard these detainees could be brought to trial but critics of phone tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal he has opted for a system of control orders whereby suspects both british and foreign can be held under house arrest or surveillance these orders will again involve a uk opt out of parts of the european convention on human rights while accepting that people have to be prepared for a possible terrorist attack mr solana said he had qualms about the home secretary s new plans we have to fight terrorism with all our means but not so far as to change our way of life he said

labour pig poster anti semitic the labour party has been accused of anti semitism over a poster depicting michael howard and oliver letwin who are both jewish as flying pigs prospective tory candidate andrew mennear whose finchley constituency contains a large jewish community branded it tasteless and offensive the poster shows the two men s faces superimposed on winged pigs and says the day the tory sums add up labour said the poster was not anti jewish but anti tory it is one of four designs e mailed to labour members who were asked to vote for their favourite mr mennear who was sent the e mail by a friend said he had been shocked by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified he said there was nothing more distasteful for a jewish person than to be associated with a pig i am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent but these sort of things can cause great offence it clearly was n t thought through it is possible the posters were designed for maximum impact but this one clearly overstepped the mark and should be withdrawn the campaign was particularly insensitive as it had come out at the same time as holocaust day a difficult time for many jewish people mr mennear added a labour spokesman denied the campaign was anti semitic as we said at the time the james report the tory backed inquiry into possible public spending savings was published pigs will fly before the tory s sums will add up this poster is making a serious point he said a conservative party spokesman said while the conservatives are concentrating on the issues that matter to people such as lower taxes and controlled immigration it is clear to see that the labour party is not people will not be fooled
iraqis win death test case probe the family of an iraqi civilian allegedly killed by uk troops have won a challenge against the government s refusal to order a full inquiry the high court ruled on tuesday that baha mousa s death in british custody in iraq fell within the european convention on human rights and the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate but judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern iraq were ruled out their families will be appealing against the judgement the families solicitor phil shiner described it as a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the uk father of two mr mousa a hotel receptionist was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queen s lancashire regiment the iraqi families lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the european convention on human rights ministry of defence lawyers argued the uk controlled area of southern iraq was outside european jurisdiction but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a uk run prison but did not apply to the total territory of another state they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died his case came within the uk s jurisdiction the other five iraqis did not die in custody so their cases had to fail they said and it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred has been timely open or effective the judges said after the ruling carla ferstman legal director of the human rights organisation redress said it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors there must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible other allegations involving british soldiers included the shooting of an iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four iraqi civilians in may both sides were granted permission to appeal prime minister tony blair s official spokesman said obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment i would point out however that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority i ca n t say anything further for obvious reasons the mod are considering whether to appeal but former british commander colonel bob stewart said anyone at the top of the military will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say if there s a case to answer let s have it out because we do n t want people thinking that british soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it he said the ministry of defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war
burglar defence guidelines issued householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted providing they were acting honestly and instinctively new guidelines say the law also protects those who use something to hand as a weapon the leaflet published by police and prosecutors aims to combat confusion about current legislation which lets people use reasonable force the guidance relating to england and wales follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law doing what you honestly and instinctively believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully the guidance said and the law protects those who use something to hand as a weapon said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service cps and association of chief police officers acpo as a general rule the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt the more force can be used lawfully in self defence it said adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of excessive and gratuitous force the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use grossly disproportionate force their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member s bill in parliament the government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary home secretary charles clarke said i believe in that old adage an englishman s home is his castle that s exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that an informal trawl of cps records found people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past years five of whom were convicted they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire before beating him up throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder in one of britain s highest profile cases norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering year old burglar fred barras in the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years mr martin was freed from prison in july the guidance published on tuesday said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were determined they would be dealt with as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible it said
woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council led by lord woolf published its proposals for england and wales it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity but that has now been changed to one sixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation he said but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said

sport betting rules in spotlight a group of mps and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport the parliamentary group on betting and gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport such as that done using the internet and mobile phones has led to more cheating the all party group recommended ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting they include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years lord condon head of the international cricket council s anti corruption unit who originally made the call for longer prison sentences said the two year penalty was derisory you could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports symbolically a higher penalty perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses might be appropriate the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters and for bookmakers to set up audit trails something the new betting exchanges already do to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced lord faulkner of worcester who chaired the inquiry said whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges because of the facility they provide to bet against a result has increased the potential for corruption it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately the panel s aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves betting exchanges allow punters to back to win but also lay to lose a horse this means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways

student inequality exposed teenagers from well off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas a report says the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between and but the percentage of poorer students hardly changed at all said its chief executive sir howard newby increasingly more women than men went to university while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference the hefce report drawing on child benefits data said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than chance of going to university while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was participation at constituency level ranged from in kensington and chelsea in the city of london and westminster and in sheffield hallam down to in bristol south and leeds central and in nottingham north and sheffield brightside sir howard said the report highlighted the entrenched divisions between rich and poor areas but added it was a social as much as an educational problem he told bbc news we know once children from deprived backgrounds get into university they do very well in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds the issue is i think one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils between the ages of and it was too late instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier even down to primary school level to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to he said but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge there were some encouraging findings he added tuition fees and student loans in england and wales and the different fee regime in scotland did not seem to have affected the choices of young people even the poorest the report also showed women were more likely than men to enter higher education in up from in in the poorest areas the gap was in women s favour and growing faster than anywhere else the higher education minister kim howells said we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education from upfront tuition fees in england would be removed with grants for the less well off the shadow education secretary tim collins said it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access the group which represents university vice chancellors universities uk said the new system of deferred fees in england due to start in with grants and bursaries for poorer students would encourage more of them to go into higher education the national union of students argued the opposite that the situation was likely to get much worse with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration the tables below show the participation rate for each parliamentary constituency in britain

david blunkett in quotes david blunkett who has resigned as home secretary built his reputation as a plain speaking yorkshire man i fell in love with someone and they would n t go public and things started to go very badly wrong in the summer and then the news of the world picked up the story i tried for three years to make something work trust plain speaking and straight talking is something which matters so much to me as a politician and as a man that i have decided of my own volition to request an independent review of the allegations that i misused my position i do n t think anyone can say i have said one thing in public and done another in private it would be dangerous territory if i was n t practising what i preach which is to always accept responsibility always accept the consequences of your actions none of us believe countering terrorism is about party politics i accepted by necessity we have to have prevention under a new category which is to intervene before the act is committed rather than do so by due process after the act is committed when it s too late he said in reference to new anti terrorism measures our work with the french government has been hugely successful said mr blunkett the number of illegal immigrants detected in dover has dropped dramatically strengthening our identity is one way or reinforcing people s confidence and sense of citizenship and well being i foolishly thought as this was a celebrity edition it would be more relaxed than normal you wake up and you receive a phone call shipman s topped himself you have just got to think for a minute is it too early to open a bottle
no election tv debate says blair tony blair has said he will not take part in a tv debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election we answer this every election campaign and for the reasons i have given before the answer is no he said at his monthly news conference in october tory leader michael howard said mr blair would be running scared if he refused calls to go head to head in recent years the leader of the opposition has always called for a debate although it has never happened before the election plans for a debate between mr blair william hague and charles kennedy collapsed in a debate between mr blair and john major was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed televised debates have become the high point of the us presidential election campaigns
brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster an issue many hoped and believed was above such things it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour as he told journalists i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers there is a complete unity of purpose and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job and would continue doing it although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long arranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference well not really as it happens and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world although in the next breath he declared i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding in so far as i read them of course he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned there are two options the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its once famed ability to strictly co ordinate announcements through the infamous downing street grid to avert just such allegations either way the effect was the same to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men firstly the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami hit countries it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt then as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott without mentioning the other all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had as a result started to set out his own platform the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission often seen as the prime minister s turf has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other the prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself
blair said he would stand down tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election a new book about the chancellor claims but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet according to the book the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other the book brown s britain said tony blair felt by november he had lost voters trust the author s sources all unnamed allies of mr blair and mr brown said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party the book serialised in the sunday telegraph alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november of his intention to stand down at that stage he saw gordon brown and said look you are the next most influential member of the government i need your help to get through the next year mr peston said i myself recognise that i m going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and i will then stand down but he changed his mind in june following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him the book claims mr peston told bbc news my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust mutual animosity i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private i do n t think the relationship is good because brown understandably feels deeply betrayed particularly over this issue of the leadership there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently following their separate responses to the asian tsunami rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blair s monthly media conference at the same time as a long planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtv s sunday programme what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out the labour mp for birkenhead asked he said the prime minister should sack mr brown but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so conservative policy co ordinator david cameron mp for witney added if it was n t so serious it would be funny but it is serious you ve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime poverty or dirty hospitals they are fighting each other carol walker bbc news political correspondent added there is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign and clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster
could rivalry overshadow election tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift ian gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring for goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re election tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster a behind closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears and it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip few in westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict it for example the weekend s attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments mr blair talked about the new labour manifesto a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year that claim was repeated in robert peston s book a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act for his part mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re elected the trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere they started with and are sustained by friends of the two men one only had to listen to the chancellor s friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister s apparent attempts to confound mr brown s leadership ambitions but it is not just public pronouncements from ex aides there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides it is no secret in westminster for example that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner then there are the actions of the men themselves gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is a media only obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation but with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off
brown in appeal for labour unity gordon brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed mr blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election the chancellor would not comment on the reports but insisted he would not be diverted or distracted from tackling the challenges faced by the country his only motivation was to ensure labour was re elected he insisted mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news according to a new book brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june in an interview with bbc one s breakfast with frost mr blair said i ve dealt with this six months ago i said then you do n t do deals over jobs like this you do n t what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country in a separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr mr brown said it s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government i think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that i have that is my purpose in politics and that is what every day i seek to do and i am not going to be diverted or distracted nor is tony blair by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip the only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do but mr peston said the pair had mutual animosity and contempt for each other and that mr blair had decided in november he would quit because he felt he had lost voters trust because of the iraq war he then changed his mind in june following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him according to the book andrew marr said this is enormously damaging gordon brown knows it as well as tony blair i think the relationship is genuinely privately very poor indeed things are very difficult he added lots of ministers believe tony blair will attempt to move gordon brown out of the treasury after the election that depends on whether there s still a labour government and their majority senior mps are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of labour backbenchers on monday health secretary john reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging labour s re election chances and would not be easily forgiven fresh speculation of a rift recently followed mr blair and mr brown s separate responses to the asian tsunami these rumours were fuelled by mr blair s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new marshall plan for africa there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a load of nonsense tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of squabbling like schoolboys liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was getting in the way of good government

blair and brown criticised by mps labour mps have angrily criticised tony blair and gordon brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men a meeting of the parliamentary labour party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise labour s election hopes the pm insisted nothing would derail labour s campaign despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside mr brown will again be in the public eye at the party s new poster launch in what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity he is due to line up alongside alan milburn the man controversially appointed as the party s election supremo and deputy leader john prescott for the event in london on tuesday relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labour s election campaign a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both and mr blair told the parliamentary labour party on monday i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the plp and were seemingly in good spirits as it started new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown labour s paul flynn said mr blair and mr brown had a scorching from mps adding it was a parliamentary labour party meeting like no other backbencher stephen pound said some mps had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if mr blair and mr brown did not stop this nonsense this poisonous briefing lord campbell savours a former mp challenged mr brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said mr prescott said mps were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports they told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders get in line he told bbc radio s today on tuesday mr prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government but he argued mr blair and mr brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war he had then changed his mind in june following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes mr peston mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential of course as a waiter for years i have a professional ability here he joked mr blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while mr brown says he will not let gossip distract him from helping a unified election campaign the conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the liberal democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government
labour mps fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election as one hugely disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting it is time they realised it s not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand as paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect stephen pound echoed the message saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division we remember the s they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors even mr prescott admitted that had he still been a backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good or can even be sustained through the campaign remains to be seen even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime minister s hand for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister s timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign mind you we have heard similar pledges before

labour seeks to quell feud talk labour s leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after mps criticised tony blair and gordon brown over reports of their rift mr brown was joined at the launch by john prescott and alan milburn the man controversially put in charge of election planning by mr blair a private meeting on monday saw normally loyal mps warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes it follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor the event was the first time mr milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking mr brown s traditional poll planning role but the pair chatted amicably and mr brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister mr brown replied you can see that our record on the economy is about the british people trusting us to run the economy he refused to comment on the new book saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government mr brown later told reporters of course i trust the prime minister downing street cited that comment when reporters suggested mr brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told mr blair there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe labour s new posters say britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the s lowest unemployment for years and the lowest mortgage rates for years they urge voters not to let the tories take things backwards mr milburn promised a poll campaign which is upbeat confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country conservative co chairman liam fox derided the photo call saying the show of unity was the worst acting i have seen since prisoner cell block h labour had broken promises by raising taxes times and brought the slowest economic growth in the english speaking world he said the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert peston s new book mr blair told mps and peers i know from everyone here in cabinet and government nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need labour s paul flynn said the pair had had a scorching from mps on tuesday deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news they told us very clearly it was the troops telling the leaders get in line the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war mr blair then changed his mind in june after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him writes mr peston mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential of course as a waiter for years i have a professional ability here he joked
labour s election love in peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days if press reports are to be believed alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other s throats over the contents of labour s next election manifesto but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning as they joined john prescott to unveil labour s latest poster campaign the event at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames was a carefully choreographed show of unity and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions labour s speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs then a vw camper van trundled into view decked out in that most mind bending of psychedelic messages lowest mortgage rate for years as the side door slid open it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together scooby doo style but sadly it was n t the cabinet who had raided the dressing up box just six rather ill at ease looking labour students two were dressed as regency dandies to unveil a poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for years another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest rates since the s the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the lowest unemployment since the seventies the politicians led out by john prescott were soberly suited as always the event may have been designed to highlight labour s economic success under mr brown but there was little doubt who was in charge the chancellor walked side by side with mr milburn pointedly exchanging chit chat as they approached the microphone but it was mr milburn who took centre stage speaking of the positive campaign the party hoped to stage in the coming weeks and months the mobile poster vans would let people know britain is working again mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour s shared purpose and united dedication it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor s record and in a final flourish to produce his famous pledge card from claiming labour has met all of its promises the event was carefully stage managed to underline cabinet unity and more specifically to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn but keen students of body language will have had a field day there was much forced smiling for the cameras but only mr prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully but it was the former health secretary s final gesture placing an arm on mr brown s back as they walked away from the microphones which was perhaps the most telling thanks for dropping by gordon he might have been saying
howard taunts blair over splits tony blair s feud with gordon brown is damaging the way the uk is governed tory leader michael howard has claimed in a heated prime minister s questions mr howard asked how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other that question was later unveiled as the headline for new tory campaign posters but mr blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people s priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by labour he can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages low inflation low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to he said the chancellor is currently on a high profile tour of africa to highlight new anti poverty plans but before doing so he insisted he still trusted mr blair despite claims to the contrary in a new book brown s britain by robert peston says there is mutual animosity between the two men it claims mr blair said in november he would stand down as prime minister before the next election but he went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him it says mr peston s book claimed that mr brown told mr blair there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe mr blair directly denied that quote on wednesday he again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit the tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor he declared he is the deals on meals prime minister no wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater he continued how can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government how can they clean up our hospitals when they do n t clean up their act mr blair said he would not respond to tittle tattle in books and promised to hail labour s record on the economy waiting lists and law and order from now until polling day later at their poster launch tory co chairman liam fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how juvenile the prime minister and chancellor were labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on tuesday where mr brown was joined by alan milburn who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor but liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc news the government is clearly split at the top this kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody later this week mr blair is expected to outline the direction of his party s next election manifesto the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made mr peston s book
how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they and their supporters need to grow up and stop bickering but this analysis in fact gets it wrong it s not just children who fight adults do too and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended but everyone wants to have the last word each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die now this is n t because the participants are stupid it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them indeed there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this nothing as obscure as post neo classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with it s often referred to as the prisoner s dilemma based on a parable much told in economics degree courses about a sheriff and two prisoners the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess and they are the only one to confess they ll be let off their crime and he tells them that if they do n t confess and they are the only one not to confess they ll get life now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess if your partner does n t confess you ll get off completely and if your partner does confess you d better confess to ensure you do n t get life the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up do n t worry if you do n t entirely follow it you can to look it up on google where there are entries on it the prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly a cold war arms race for example a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms rather than a lot of arms but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners dilemma unless you are repeating the experience many times over it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on somehow the incentives have to change in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in if the rest of the party can enforce that they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly
blair looks to election campaign tony blair s big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign that poll may still be about weeks away but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto there was a detailed account of the government s past record with a major emphasis on the economy and public services there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly new labour although that may continue to irritate his chancellor there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about a new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society his was more a speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what new labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach and for some that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something that it is as he said more than an electoral device to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters in a key section he declared in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability every family not just the fortunate few knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship every adult including those who missed out at school able to get the skills then need to advance home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions under what is to be the general election slogan britain is working the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour that might get under the skin of mr brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post war chancellor britain has had probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services an unremittingly new labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that the belief patients and parents for example want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word but for now all eyes have been focused on the next general election and for many in westminster mr blair s performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on may
tories unveil quango blitz plans plans to abolish quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than bn among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies such as boards tackling industrial development and housing their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people rather than officials run hospitals and surgeries announcing the plans mr redwood said mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers and has broken the pledges he made far from improving public services spending taxpayers money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats more regulation and higher taxes his party leader michael howard argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending labour are creating two britains the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain he said in the real world people are working harder just to stand still they ve seen their pensions knocked for six they re being squeezed by extra taxes the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain the government has announced plans to cut civil servants as part of its efficiency drive but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans the conservatives are committed to cutting labour s public spending plans by a massive billion he said cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting bureaucracy but would require massive cuts to front line public services such as schools hospitals and the police the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services
peers debate crown succession law peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne labour peer lord dubs succession to the crown bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister the private member s bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics the fabian society s sundar katwala said the change was long overdue and that he expected a warm response the political reform group s general secretary told bbc radio s today programme there were some very out dated features at the heart of britain s constitution in the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures we hope they are warm towards it and do n t say this is the wrong time he pointed out that it was years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill mr katwala added this is long overdue parliament will have to do it eventually the government and i hope all of the political parties might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos but he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election he said he hoped the bill would be a gentle nudge to the government and suggested it would demand a response the bill which is in the lords for its second reading has been adopted by former chief whip ann taylor in the commons the rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the act of settlement which confirmed in that it was for parliament to determine the title to the throne
ukip s secret weapon by any measure new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else a winner this is the man who some pundits believe was almost single handedly responsible for bill clinton s sensational comeback victory but morris is no ideologue he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay now he is back in london as the uk independence party s not so secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped you guessed it opposition candidate viktor yushchenko if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances that he enjoys the game more than the politics so why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election on this subject morris appears almost evangelical i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so was ukip leader roger knapman i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism a great soundbite but a surprise coming from a new yorker post september it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who do n t believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined that s international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary fund the world bank and primarily the european union so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable the tory party is schizophrenic about europe but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they ca n t possibly re negotiate anything as michael howard is pledged to do it s like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody possibly a very american analogy but another great soundbite the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it so is ukip s job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroy silk once notoriously declared no the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move but it s not just to shift the tories i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair s decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro and while we are on the subject of mr kilroy silk mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites robert kilroy silk is not a team player it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one so what is the big plan for the general election how will he achieve the breakthrough look we are not going to be forming the next government he said neither does ukip have to fight every seat as with the us presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats just as he believes it will in britain so with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll the internet was a decisive factor in the presidential election through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries people just did it anything can happen in the next general election there is an inherent instability at the moment labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice that might he suggests lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power it is a huge task surely but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises even while most still believe it is labour s for the taking ukip s performance in last year s european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus and after all he has a reputation to sustain
more reforms ahead says milburn labour will continue to pursue controversial reforms if it wins a third term in power the party s election chief alan milburn has said he pledged labour would encourage more people to achieve their aspirations what we want is for more people to earn and own mr milburn told bbc radio s today show tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin called labour a brilliant machine for talking about things but said it did not deliver policies the country needs meanwhile the liberal democrats president simon hughes said new labour has lost people s confidence in a way old labour never did mr milburn told today that labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in britain pressed on incapacity benefits he said the tax and welfare system must provide the right incentives to people no one is talking about driving people into work but what we do know is there are one million people on incapacity benefit who want the opportunity to work providing the right level of support is there for them however backbench labour mp karen buck warned against proposed changes in such benefits she told the today programme if the policy is seen as being about how do you make the feckless poor go back to work then it is not going to work on the one hand and it is not going to improve our electoral chances on the other mr milburn also sought to draw a line under the controversy about reports of a feud between gordon brown and prime minister tony blair he stressed that mr brown would play the same role that he did in the last election mr milburn gave more details of planned reforms in a speech to labour s fabian society in which he also praised mr brown as one of the leaders of the party s reform process in the speech he backed choice in schools and hospitals wider home ownership and changes to the welfare system mr milburn insisted that government reform must continue our task is to rebuild the new labour coalition around one nation politics that recognise while life is hard for many all should have the chance to succeed he said there is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country in our first two terms we have raised it in our third term we have to break it voters turned on the party when it failed to reform industrial relations in the s he also told his audience oliver letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services such as cleaner hospitals discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets he said ministers had not delivered cleaner hospitals with people dying from infections last year new labour had failed on school discipline because it had not implemented serious reforms so that teachers could run schools and which would give parents choice he went on for the lib dems simon hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there would n t be tuition fees and more debt have been given exactly the opposite he added under new labour all households are still paying unfair council tax rather than a fairer alternative
teens know little of politics teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics and have little knowledge only a quarter of year olds knew that labour was the government the tories were the official opposition and the lib dems were the third party almost all could identify tony blair but only one in six knew who michael howard was and just one in recognised charles kennedy the icm survey interviewed pupils for education watchdog ofsted nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for and of those questioned thought the conservatives were in power while of them believed the lib dems were the survey also looked at issues of nationality it found the union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being british many of the pupils also looked on themselves as english scottish or welsh rather than british while the notion of being european hardly occurred to anyone
defection timed to hit tax pledge with impeccable and precisely calculated timing tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard s latest announcement on taxation and spending with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories resolutely depressing poll showings the big idea is his bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one s breakfast with frost programme he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now but without any concrete pledges but mr howard announced that of the bn he has earmarked from savings bn will be used to plug labour s claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin s first budget he would not be precise but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax but he did for the first time say there would be such tax cuts at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less it is the tories attempt to open that famed clear blue water between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact mr howard however was dismissive these things happen from time to time there are disagreements between robert jackson and me the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did he added and that is certainly true the election will be decided on the economy stupid other issues like the iraq war and the trust thing will also play a major part but it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda mr howard knows that risks accusations that as a result he would slash public services so he has attempted to shoot that fox first with polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts he has suggested that is exactly what he will do whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen
tory leader unveils spending plan tory leader michael howard says his party can save bn in government spending by tackling waste the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps robert jackson a former minister to labour mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election let s be realistic the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did he told bbc s breakfast with frost programme however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives spending plans fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday the bulk of the bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services mr howard said the bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing he added however the remainder would deal with some of the unfair taxes almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes mr howard insisted because borrowing is going up it is out of control that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both so part of the bn we are going to apply to filling the government s black hole reducing the borrowing the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today mr howard is expected to say that around bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble shooter david james home office spending could be cut by bn according to the final instalment of his year long review savings of m at the foreign office and m at the department for culture media and sport have also been identified in all almost a quarter of a million jobs and public bodies would go under mr james proposals mr howard said all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less however chief treasury secretary paul boateng said none of the tories figures add up so they ca n t make these savings and ca n t pay for any tax cuts which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is bn of cuts hitting frontline public services hard liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added people will not be taken in by michael howard s claims of bn worth of savings this ca n t be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities a poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century labour will hold key marginal constituencies winning a majority of the populus survey suggests and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives leaving the tories with just mps two less than they returned atlabour s landslide and their worst showing since
kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition but the liberal democrats are entering the expected election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his party s ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party s westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self delusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name
best person for top legal job the best person for the job should be appointed lord chancellor and not necessarily a lawyer or mp the courts minister has told mps under reforms the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions the lord chancellor no more needs to be a lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be a doctor said courts minister christopher leslie the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday mr leslie said the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons under the reforms the law lords will also be replaced as the uk s highest legal authority by a supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers in december the lords rejected a plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer the peers voted by to to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor he said what matters most is whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties it is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges shadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an exceptional institution providing a champion of the independence of the judiciary the government had initially proposed to take this institution and smash it to pieces mr grieve said convention should be nurtured and celebrated but the government distrusted and disliked it instead he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the house of lords the government would have great difficulty in getting the bill through parliament former cabinet minister douglas hogg whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor said the bill was largely unnecessary bureaucratic and expensive but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellor s role and office cannot be frozen in aspic
the memory driving brown s mission the memory gordon brown says keeps returning to him the one that he says is burnt into him is that of a year old girl whose parents died of aids and who is hiv positive herself mr brown seems haunted by her eyes desolate of all hope and then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of kenya s largest slum advancing with crowded menace flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of free education free education for all mr brown s message generally that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered but he is such a pivotal figure in british politics it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this his answer in part is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father s church ever since he says africa has been important to him i ve absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt but he also believes it is time for the world to see a new gordon brown not the dull reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion and it just so happens the labour party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators there s also a sense of liberation if mr blair wo n t allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and he d much rather be out examining social problems in the raw it also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself if he can help the world s poor just a little then it shows politics is n t worthless but is his vision for africa too grand can poverty in the continent really be halved brown replies that no one thought the berlin wall would ever come down either he s still got to overcome not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just wo n t in the end spend wisely
howard dismisses tory tax fears michael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for bn tax cuts are too modest he defended the package saying it was a plan for the tories first budget and he hoped to be able to go further the tories on monday highlighted bn in wasteful spending they would stop to allow tax cuts reduced borrowing and more spending on key services labour and the liberal democrats say the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party s mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted tory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the financial times i would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts interviewed on bbc radio s jeremy vine show mr howard said it is perfectly true that i am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts on the other side there are people who say we wo n t be able to achieve these tax cuts i think we have got it about right mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes he added i would like to be able to do more and over time i am sure we will be able to do more but at the start we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go in our first budget i have got to be responsible about this the latest tory plans came as campaigning for the election widely expected in may gathered pace the liberal democrats launched their pre election platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees lib dem treasury spokesman vince cable also branded the tory plans as fantasy economics labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a fraudulent prospectus the party on tuesday challenged the tories to publish the full report from david james the trouble shooter they asked to identify possible savings but the tories are in turn demanding that tony blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election
donor attacks blair brown feud the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its poor response to the asian tsunami crisis his broadside came as ex foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point mr bannatyne has previously given labour he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs the year old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives robert peston s new book has prompted more speculation about the blair brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in to stand down mr bannatyne said disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition the businessman whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq and he branded the uk government s response to the tsunami as piecemeal and poor the people there need practical help not just pledges of money he said the us has forces helping on the ground we can do more british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on bbc business start up programme dragon s den but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt in a separate development robin cook gave his support to mr brown s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour s election but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not perceived as a problem by the voters adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was not an alternative source of opposition to the government he warned the abstentions party was the real challenge to labour and they would not be motivated by mr blair s promise to produce an unremittingly new labour election manifesto his comments come after dave prentis the leader of britain s biggest union unison told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader
howard and blair tax pledge clash tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour s manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post election budget mr blair derided tory claims they could cut bn in wasteful spending saying the party had got its sums wrong the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre election period mr howard told mps that every independent expert from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes mr blair replied i think they are wrong for this very simple reason that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth bn although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services labour and the liberal democrats have said the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes the liberal democrats have also launched their pre election platform with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition particularly on the iraq war council tax and university tuition fees labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a fraudulent prospectus
what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays one starbucks one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories new headquarters in victoria street just down the road from the commons that should make things a little easier if and when the crack of dawn election press conferences kick off unlike there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside or to buy scooters to get themselves between the tightly timetabled events and to all intents and purposes we already appear to be in that general election campaign certainly the press conference hosted by election co ordinator alan milburn in the rather compact new conference room still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained had all the hallmarks of an election event welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre he said and i ll bet he had n t checked that one with gordon brown along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare to work scheme which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost in unemployment and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering billion of tax cuts labour has come up with a figure of billions worth of efficiency savings so understandably perhaps believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra billion these figures based on the two parties own detailed studies will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign wednesday was just the start
amnesty chief laments war failure the lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups amnesty international s chief has said in a lecture at the london school of economics irene khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since september she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message and it had to fight poverty not just focus on political rights for elites ms khan highlighted detentions without trial including those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems what s a new challenge is the way in which this age old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war she said by using the language of war human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war ms khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world the human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights she said that was accompanied by a crisis of governance where the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account the amnesty secretary general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups she said ms khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system there needed to be a drive to use simpler language talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world she said the human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments al qaeda for example was not going to be impressed by a traditional amnesty letter writing campaign more also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations amnesty international members voted in to extend the organisation s work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too ms khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife we would be an elitist bunch working for the elites for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read she said despite her concerns ms khan dubbed herself a hope monger saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges
blair sees greater bush consensus george w bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as us president tony blair has said the prime minister said mr bush had learned military force was not the only way to fight terrorism he understood that the best prospect of peaceful co existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights mr blair told the guardian newspaper mr bush was sworn in at a ceremony in washington dc on thursday echoing the new us secretary of state condoleezza rice the prime minister said there has been a clear evolution of us policy since the war in afghanistan in mr blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with mr bush the president understood that while military and security measures were important there also needed to be a multilateral approach to solving the world s problems turning to critics fears that the us was poised for further military action mr blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against iran the prime minister conceded that the us had what appears to be a harder position towards the state than europe but the prime minister pointed out that until now the us had allowed britain france and germany to take the lead in trying to halt the iranian nuclear programme following claims that us forces had worked inside iran to identify potential targets mr blair was asked if the sas had also been in the country we never answer questions about special forces but do not take that as indicating an affirmative said mr blair mr blair said he believed the president was keen to work with other countries while trying to spread democracy and human rights it is significant in my view that he is coming to europe as his first foreign visit said mr blair following his inauguration mr bush is due in europe at the end of january

blair blasts tory spending plans tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans saying they are a ludicrous improbability the prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut bn in wasteful spending to allow bn in tax cuts on saturday tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing inefficiencies which had burgeoned under labour in his speech mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party which had learned to occupy the political centre ground with a hidebound tory party which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts mr blair said the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk both britain s hard won economic stability the lowest mortgages inflation unemployment for decades and the key investment in public services i believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it s possible to imagine he said it s a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in years of conservative government mr blair added they the conservatives have learned nothing by contrast he said new labour had listened to its electorate and changed mr blair went on to list his government s achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party so now we have a choice we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back and i say we have to fight in response david davis said the tories would make cuts such as removing regional assemblies but would bring in more police officers and match labour s spending on health and education everybody knows having lived through this government the last seven years that they faced lots of stealth tactics lots of increases in taxes but no improvement in public services he said mr davis said labour had been responsible for huge waste huge overspending not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government less waste and lower taxes with a tory government he concluded gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors the chancellor said the conservatives plans would see some bn in spending cuts by which the tories deny mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be distracted or diverted according to an advance text released by officials he told delegates we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long term decisions necessary to meet them mr brown warned that the tories were planning the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto meanwhile tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of misrepresenting the party s proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans he still cannot accept the simple truth which is that we will spend more on what matters to people schools hospitals and police and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes mr letwin said once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election which taxes will they put up to fill the bn shortfall in their plans
lib dems bold election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two with his party s previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government he has switched tack now he is promising to levy a modest increase of the same amount on earnings over a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges they are to scrap student fees finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax that last policy will also see about of the most well off paying more while others pensioners in particular will pay less labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through bn efficiency savings while labour has offered bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the s and early s but unlike the old tory labour debate he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas once again with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration mr kennedy is stressing the different more liberal approach of his party mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party s election chances declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll he repeated his pledge not to do post election deals with either party after the election mr kennedy went on to suggest the re election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a massive vote of no confidence in tony blair s government that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before
kennedy s cautious optimism charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election in his years in the commons he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and he might say the uk s political and electoral system but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months time look i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around he said he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the real opposition but does n t that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second he is prepared to go this far a clear conclusion has been reached including by conservatives that the conservatives are not going to win this election therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced but have n t we been here before with suggestions in the s that labour was finished wo n t voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives the problem is that geographically the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain and they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters he insists his three headline commitments to be financed from a tax increase on those earning over a year will appeal right across the political spectrum they are to replace the council tax with a local income tax provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election he said under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise while the tories plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible he claims we are being straightforward with people saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies that is a clear cut choice for people one i am very comfortable with and i think will distinguish us from the others as to his own future he is clear if as expected his party increases its showing at the election he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that if the tories do as badly as some fear the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side
ukip candidate suspended in probe eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed john houston was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election but he was suspended after his reported views including the return of the british empire were sent to two scottish newspapers ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip soon after the high profile departure of mep robert kilroy silk mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be made available to law abiding members of the community and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade the document reportedly said we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire the problems for the human race environmental and others can only be dealt with on a global scale and that calls for a radical alliance of the english speaking nations which they are uniquely able to do mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy which they were not he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate he told bbc news he appears to have said these things we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting it is simply a distraction from the task in hand the eu constitution not individual idiocies mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying i feel ukip have over reacted and overshot the runway peter nielson who is ukip scotland chairman said he had suspended mr houston on friday night he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party he added i ca n t comment too much at the moment i have one version from him but i have n t seen the papers yet

tories leave door open for archer the conservative party would deal sympathetically with any application by disgraced peer lord archer to rejoin its ranks its co chairman has said dr liam fox told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme there was no place for vindictiveness in politics lord archer spent two years in prison after being convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice the former tory deputy chairman s five year suspension from the party has just elapsed a jury ruled that lord archer lied during a libel trial against the daily star at the high court in london in he won damages after the newspaper printed allegations about involvement with a prostitute dr fox was asked if he would say yes or no if lord archer applied to rejoin i m sure that in line with people having served their sentence and having done some reparations for what they did wrong we would look at that sympathetically i do n t believe in vindictiveness i do n t think that has any place in politics unlike the prime minister and alastair campbell tory peer lord tebbit said he agreed with dr fox s view and said the case should be looked at on its merits after all he is far from being the worst perjurer in the world he added meanwhile senior conservative mp sir teddy taylor warned that moves bring lord archer back into the fold could be controversial he said i suppose on a sunday in particular we should always make provision for forgiving sinners but there is no doubt it would be controversial lord archer who was not available for comment remains a popular figure among constituency tory parties and is a successful fundraiser he has not been seen in the house of lords since his release from prison in july although there is nothing in the rules to prevent him from attending
mandelson warns bbc on campbell the bbc should steer away from demonising ex downing street media chief alastair campbell peter mandelson has said the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour dirty tricks campaign that charge was denied by mr mandelson who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell s campaigning skills he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street sexed up iraq s weapons of mass destruction dossier the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies director general greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howard s past mr mandelson a former labour communications director told bbc radio s today programme i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills what i understand less is why the bbc should be joining with the tories in driving that agenda in my experience of these things parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics the trivialisation of the campaign i think the bbc would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone concentrate on the issues as i say not resume their demonisation of alastair campbell we all know where that led before mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour which denies engaging in personal campaigning conservative co chairman liam fox said mr campbell s return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard recently withdrawn from the party s website were a sign of abusive politics the government despite the fact that they would say want to go forward not back seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly about the future he said on sunday labour peer baroness kennedy who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks this feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might she said
conservative backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id the decision follows a tough meeting where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move party sources told the bbc the bill which ministers claim will tackle crime terrorism and illegal immigration is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats they have said the scheme is deeply flawed and a waste of money sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary the party has been agnostic on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence the tory source said despite giving their backing to id cards the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect a spokesman said it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues concerns over id cards the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it the new chairman of the bar council guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the margins of society would be driven into the hands of extremists what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere they are going to be stopped if they have n t id cards they are going to be detained
taxes must be trusted kennedy public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue lib dem leader charles kennedy has said a day ahead of the government s pre budget report mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to painful economic realities he said the current level of taxation was about right although he would put a new tax on top earners other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises mr kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation the lib dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and wednesday s speech did not announce new policies speaking at the commonwealth club mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver he said budgets have to add up tough choices are needed in public spending the lib dems would cut low priority spending including the government s id cards scheme and the child trust fund those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over s putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks he said the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a p rise on income tax now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the polluter who pays the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises mr kennedy said that contract with the people that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown the obvious unfairness of our current tax system especially the council tax and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the government s performance conservative co chairman liam fox said liam fox said if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their spending commitments the reality is the lib dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy and the only people who would face tough choices would be the families who would be worse off a year and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up he accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more

election deal faltered over heath role the tories failed to hold onto power in after liberals demanded sir edward heath quit in return for co operation documents released after years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic february general election liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government but it partly collapsed over the conservative leader s own role prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form a labour government the february general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control sir edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis a miners strike and the subsequent three day week labour emerged with the most seats but its mps were short of the number mr wilson needed to form a majority sir edward who had received more votes but had fewer mps believed he had the authority to remain at number providing the liberal mps would support his government he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the government s programme or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal mr thorpe was in high spirits having just led his party to a historic jump in support he also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties but sir edward said that was impossible because the labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a conservative liberal pact hours later sir edward s hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpe s colleagues refused to support him jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally reads a telephone memo for mr heath they feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister asked if this was his own view he said no it was not i am very close to ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult the following day the stickling points had clearly become two fold mr thorpe s colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edward s resignation mr thorpe told sir edward i am sorry this is obviously hell a nightmare on stilts for you somehow i personally hope that we can work something out four hours later sir edward called the liberal leader back to downing street in a last attempt at a deal the minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister mr thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime minister s colleagues documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a labour led coalition but he already knew mr wilson would not form a coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government

prime minister s questions so who if anyone is playing politics with the security of the nation michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who he claims is ramming through parliament the controversial new anti terror measures without proper debate he did n t say so but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws he demanded the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament is not the opposition against to the proposed laws in principle in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless what this is really about believes mr blair is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass maybe even defeat the government and that is more important to them than national security liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue he preferred to state that as with other issues like id cards the government s immediate instinct was authoritarian as is his habit nowadays the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have once again just missed the point apart from all that it was electioneering as usual the very first question to the prime minister from derby north s bob laxton asked him in effect if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools later birmingham s sion simon even went so far as to suggest the tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now the prime minister almost blushed this was not the appropriate place to announce election day he stammered but can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away an announcement coming in the week beginning april for an election on may is where the big money is in the commons and perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment

manchester wins labour conference the labour party will hold its autumn conference in manchester and not blackpool it has been confirmed the much trailed decision was ratified by labour s ruling national executive committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue it will be the first time since that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event blackpool will get the much smaller february spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool bournemouth and brighton and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort in the party said it would not return to blackpool but did so in the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference colin asplin blackpool hotel association said we have tried very hard to make sure they come back to blackpool obviously we have failed in that i just hope manchester can handle the crowds it amazes me that the labour party which is a working class party does n t want to come to the main working class resort in the country the exact cost to blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major manchester hotels after the official announcement
labour attacked on howard poster labour has been accused of using anti semitic images in posters which critics claim depict tory leader michael howard as fagin the poster shows mr howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch saying i can spend the same money twice the image prompted concern from the editor of the jewish chronicle but labour insists it is simply anti tory labour later took the image off its website saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members the party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin with a blackboard reading the hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the dickens character fagin in the stage version of the musical oliver there was controversy over another poster choice offered to labour members it showed mr howard and mr letwin who are both jewish as flying pigs mr howard did not comment on the anti semitism claims when asked about the poster on monday instead he pointed to how tony blair had in complained about personalised abusive campaigning mr howard told greater manchester radio it is such a pity that mr blair does n t practise what he preaches jewish chronicle editor ned temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e mails from jewish chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image shylock and fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries old prejudice he told bbc radio s world at one whatever the idea is i think it s a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning mr temko said he blamed cock up not conspiracy saying he did not detect inherent anti semitism in any of the parties election campaigns the poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to labour members who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election labour mp louise ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti semitic when they only challenged tory economic policies labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said the poster had been misunderstood the image simply portrayed mr howard as a hypnotist he argued concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but i would emphasise that if you see the posters the common theme is that the tories are trying to con you a labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party s website was not affected by the row this has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss he said but a conservative spokeswoman said this poster campaign which was offensive to many people was a big misjudgement by labour s campaign team
milburn defends poster campaign labour s election chief alan milburn has defended his party s campaign posters amid tory claims the ads were nothing short of sly anti semitism mr milburn said he appreciated people s concerns but insisted that what they were was anti tory and not in any way shape or form anti semitic he was responding to tory spokesman julian lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs a row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict michael howard who is jewish as fagin and as a flying pig amid claims they were anti semitic the posters were labelled a big misjudgement by the conservatives who said labour s first shot in the election has badly backfired the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members who were asked to vote on their favourite labour has taken them off its website saying members preferred other posters the party s four new designs launched on tuesday steer clear of the fagin or flying pig images but make clear that labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the tory leader personally with reminders of his record in office the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election in the commons tory spokesman mr lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded mps that labour chairman ian mccartney last year described shadow chancellor oliver letwin as a st century fagin given the outrage that that smear caused then how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti semitism mr milburn replied that they were not anti semitic what they were was anti tory and i make no apologies at all for making clear to the british public exactly what the conservative plans would mean he said i fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the labour party website the fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off labour s website on monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin holding a blackboard reading a labour spokesman later said their removal from the party s website was not affected by the row

immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time but no longer both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or alternatively running scared of addressing the problem but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry and to kick out more failed asylum seekers that has been attacked by the tories as too little too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europe wide policy on immigration but while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers my concern is that whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate right wing political parties picking up on statements like burden to britain will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty it is precisely that concern and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right s racist agenda that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue the challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap
kennedy begins pre election tour liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has begun a week long tour to persuade voters they are the real opposition mr kennedy is visiting constituencies in somerset and hampshire on monday rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives later he will visit places such as liverpool where labour is targeted labour say a lib dem vote could let the tories in while the tories say the lib dems would mean higher taxes soft crime laws more power to europe mr kennedy s tour comes as he labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election widely expected to be held on may on tuesday mr kennedy will visit leicester south where lib dem mp parmjit singh gill overturned a big labour majority to win the seat in last year s by election stops in shrewsbury north dorset liverpool manchester basingstoke and west london are planned for later in the week the liberal democrats say in the northern cities the race is between them and labour while in southern seats particularly the south west it is between them and the tories speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday mr kennedy said the upcoming general election widely tipped for may would be much more unpredictable than any others in recent experience asked whether it was realistic to assume the liberal democrats could win the general election he said there s no limit to the ambitions we have as a party but we have got to be responsible we have got to be credible we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task mr kennedy said the british public felt let down by labour on issues from iraq to top up fees and the conservatives were not asking the critical questions and he said people were highly sceptical about labour and conservative promises on tax but he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in by the back door if you look at the four previous parliamentary by elections the liberal democrats have demonstrated that not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position but we can go on to defeat the government that s going to be the story i think of this coming general election
labour s core support takes stock tony blair has told labour supporters he s back and still hungry for the job of prime minister but does that sum up the mood at the party s spring conference in gateshead the electorate are keener on the government than some labour party members is the dry assessment of graham lane leader of the labour group on newham council the problem according to mr lane is not continuing divisions over iraq foundation hospitals or tuition fees or even voter apathy but mr blair himself i have a new slogan vote blair get brown that s what i am telling people on the doorstep do n t worry he will be gone soon his friend saxon spence leader of devon county labour group lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others you cannot underestimate the impact of the war in iraq we lost people from our local party who had some key roles but the two friends were fired up by gordon brown s speech on saturday with its appeal to core labour values on social justice health and education there was real passion i think we have all felt a little jaded but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place said mrs spence if he had n t have walked off the stage they would still be clapping added mr lane but for every brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of mr blair stephen douglas from wales said after the pm s speech on sunday i think it was a bit of a turning point given the roasting he has had on some issues the guy still has it tony martin of burnley said he is the first leader who has won us two terms this bloke has delivered for us malcolm shipley of shipley said it was as if he is coming round to the right approach again katrina bull a prospective parliamentary candidate said mr blair had shown he could rouse the party s grassroots i think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with tony the way we have today we will have no problem with turnout she had just emerged from a q a session in which mr blair tieless and supremely at ease answered questions posed via the party s website a party of councillors from nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with mr blair s leadership and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever iraq they insisted would not be a factor for most voters the biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election it might sound great but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and i think that is the greater problem than iraq said nottingham city councillor brian parbutt and even mr blair s most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing he is a master of the sort of glossy high profile campaigning that has become labour s hallmark epitomised by friday s whistle stop tour of marginal seats a group of shop stewards from the swan hunter shipyard who said they were facing redundancy could barely suppress their anger at mr blair s failure to as they saw it shake off his tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the north east they were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue sage centre heralded by john prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of labour s success in urban regeneration it is no good having the sage or baltic if you have n t got the money for the entrance fee said terry telford but when asked about mr blair s bravura performance on friday the men agreed he was brilliant and they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the labour message come election time if you are not fired up about the election then what s the point there is no complacency as far as i can see in the labour party we are fired up we are up for this election said richie porterhouse mr telford agreed but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked what has labour done for the north east i have had doors slammed in my face he said every activist i spoke to said they were proud of what they believed labour had achieved in their local communities the new hospitals and schools the better life chances for young people the problem they faced they said was converting this local feelgood factor into votes but they could at least rely on one secret weapon as one activist put it tory leader michael howard
campaign cold calls questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people s voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioner s office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run up to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations in summary whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them

lib dems target first time buyers the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build new affordable homes on publicly owned land the party s scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust as a way of getting onto the housing ladder the lib dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites labour has already announced plans to help first time buyers and the tories would extend right to buy schemes all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run up to the election after a survey suggested first time buyers could not afford a home in of uk towns the lib dems say their mutual homes would let people buy a share of a property usually worth about of the building costs party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land donated by central or local government people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land he added they would spend about of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property when they moved house they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account mr kennedy said mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually investing only as much as they can afford there are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities the kind of golden share used by the lib dems in south shropshire could be rolled out more widely under the plan councils secure deals with developers where they keep a share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market instead they are sold at build cost to people who the local council decides have local needs the party says its help for first time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer but the plans involve changing the vat system which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings the conservatives claimed the plans would amount to an extra tax of up to on every new house this is typical of lib dem hypocrisy said tory shadow local government secretary caroline spelman they claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market the flagship tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes labour has said it will allow council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes housing minister keith hill said much of the lib dem plans mimicked the government s strategy however as usual the lib dems proposals are completely uncosted he said mr hill said he also asked whether the lib dems would match labour s promise to spend bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by

will tory tax cuts lift spirits michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts should he win the next general election he has earmarked billion that will be used to reduce taxes although he still will not say which or how this was the pre election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax all the money would come from its billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that billion would go on spending plans with billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye catching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned bn efficiency savings simply do n t add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy one of new labour s greatest successes before the historic election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely and the prime minister probably hopes that the economy will be the deciding factor
teenagers to be allowed to be mps teenagers will be able to become mps under plans unveiled by ministers in a written statement constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said the current minimum age of for an mp would be reduced to the proposals follow a recommendation last year by elections watchdog the electoral commission the government intends to legislate when parliamentary time allows to lower the age said mr leslie who was elected in at the age of even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election widely predicted for may the announcement from mr leslie who was elected in in a formerly safe tory seat prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to the votes at alliance said it was a good thing to engage people by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective candidacy affects only politicians the voting age affects millions of younger people said spokesman alex folkes we would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age currently candidates in both local and national votes must be while the voting age is that is because the age of majority was reduced to in but laws dating from which determine the current voting age stayed in place irish republican bernadette devlin was one of just a handful of year olds elected to parliament in the th century winning a seat in but the youngest is understood to have been tory edward turnour who won the horsham by election aged and days and served in parliament for continuous years last april s report by the electoral commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at the commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age
labour s four little words labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which for those just returned from the planet galifray is looming the slogan britain forward not back no it s not an instruction from one of those inter planetary time lords is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky it s always there but we mostly stop noticing the word britain is cast on a red background a nod to old labour forward is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and along with not back is set against a mushy pea green background as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared it was all very post modern or something great use of colour those ad men really do earn their money and coincidentally the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so called fagin posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but as election supremo alan milburn declared are doing a very good job mr milburn in the latest in his series of pre election campaign campaigning explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards not many people talk about the years before as the good old days he declared it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories nobody he claimed could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling they could however picture michael howard or of course tony blair doing it so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition s policies and past record and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign he said between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain not overseas he promised he will be leading the domestic debate from the front listening taking the flak so let s get on with it then
tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner under plans unveiled by the conservatives party leader michael howard said the new role would replace inconspicuous police authorities he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing while labour criticised extravagant tory promises on policing responding to the plans the chairman of the police federation of england and wales which represents rank and file officers said it was essential operational independence was retained jan berry said it is a service not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground she warned outlining his crime manifesto mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have he told bbc radio s today programme the trouble is and it s no reflection on the people who are on the police authority they are good people but hardly anyone knows who they are mr howard said the authorities were not providing the local accountability that we want to see and that elected police commissioners would be more visible critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community lord harris who sits on the executive of association of police authorities said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician that is overturning nearly years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions he said liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a minimum policing guarantee with their chief constables a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard s record saying police numbers had fallen by when he was home secretary he said today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system the tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an american sheriff other tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences
tv debate urged for party chiefs broadcasters should fix a date for a pre election televised debate between the three main political leaders according to the hansard society it would then be up to tony blair michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part the non partisan charity said chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter of public interest the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead he said lord holme s proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry he said it was a democratically dubious proposition that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here if mr blair did not want to take part the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why lord holme said what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate no one has heard directly from the prime minister he said it has been left to nudges and winks hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair does n t want one but we have n t heard from the prime minister himself lord holme who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections said broadcasters were more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes he said lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead as soon as the election is called an independent third party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public he said it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse said lord holme if the prime minister s reported position is true and he does want to take part he would then be obliged to say why publicly the broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well understood reasons or going ahead with an empty chair either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in and tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign last month he said we answer this every election campaign and for the reasons i have given before the answer is no he said at his monthly news conference

blair joins school sailing trip the prime minister has donned a life jacket and joined school children in a sailing dinghy as he sought to sell his party s education policies tony blair sailed across the lake in bromsgrove worcestershire while on a visit with education secretary ruth kelly to back school outings mr blair later stressed labour s election pledge to focus on education when he met parents in the area the conservatives and lib dems both say his pledges are worthless all the parties are stepping up campaigning ahead of a general election widely expected to be held on may mr blair looking a little windswept joined two girls from st egwin s middle school in evesham and an instructor for a trip in the wayfarer dinghy closely followed by a boat full of photographers afterwards he said outdoor activities were beneficial for children but accepted that lots of teachers now worried about taking part for fear of being sued if something went wrong what we re doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action mr blair said when you are doing these types of activities you ve got to exercise some common sense there obviously you ca n t have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that they re going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character the pledge on education your child achieving more was one of six election pledges unveiled by mr blair last week if it wins a third term in the general election expected this year labour is committed to giving parents more choice between schools allowing all secondary schools to take on specialist status opening city academies and creating more sixth form places it aims to improve discipline in schools by adopting a zero tolerance approach to disruption of classes and introducing fixed penalty notices for truants labour also plans to give head teachers at groups of local schools control over funding for units to handle disruptive pupils parents and teachers who met mr blair on tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their mps to raise concerns about education it is the latest in a series of events designed to show the prime minister is speaking directly to voters in the run up to the election and that he has not lost touch for the conservatives shadow education secretary tim collins said mr blair s government is all talk he must be judged on what he has done in two terms not what he mendaciously claims he would do in a third that judgment will be damning the liberal democrats are promising to cut class sizes for the youngest children and ensure all children are taught by a qualified teacher in each subject
analysis no pain no gain he called it his masochism strategy in the run up to the iraq war and now tony blair has signed up for another dose of pain the idea is simple the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of real voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras the theory is that talking to the great british public even if they are the great unwashed is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people s concerns and on occasions of their outright fury mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run up to the election labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin control freakery and over slick presentation sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen mr blair s latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday the trouble began on the wright stuff show with maria hutchings marching up to him saying tony that s rubbish as she tried to complain about her autistic son s school being threatened with closure a few do n t worries as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match he spoke to her privately after the show but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce writer neil coppendale from west sussex asked of the iraq war tens of thousands of innocent men women and children died how do you manage to sleep at night on immigration london teacher diane granger said where are you going to put everyone and can you imagine even jeremy paxman putting the question posed by brighton nurse marion brown would you wipe somebody s backside for mr blair tried to use the questioners first names and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a pr stunt which backfired indeed there is a danger mr blair simply ends up looking embattled conservative michael howard and liberal democrat charles kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence james humphreys ex head of corporate communications at number says the strategy shows frustration with the media they feel they do n t get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion he says there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls he argues the prime minister knows full well the potential hazards he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the election campaign all you do is walk around and make yourself known you do n t do anything to help anybody she told mr blair before stomping off refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately former downing street media chief alastair campbell has described the episode as a bit of a disaster as it meant the launch of labour s election manifesto received little coverage but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive not least because it coincided with john prescott s even more direct contact when he punched an egg throwing protester former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public the undoubted highlight of years of election phone in shows was margaret thatcher discomfort on nationwide in when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the election campaign with his famous soapbox it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added fizz to his campaign in his memoirs he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnock s contrived photo opportunities and attempts at an artful campaign he wanted to look like a prime minister i was prime minister and i wanted a flesh and blood fight says mr major mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phone ins and public meetings could enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim no pain no gain
brown names march for budget chancellor gordon brown will deliver his budget to the house of commons on march the treasury has announced the budget likely to be the last before the general election will be at about gmt on that wednesday just after prime minister s question time the annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government s taxation and broader economic predictions the tories say it is likely the budget will contain measures to attract votes the election is expected on may next month s budget will be mr brown s ninth since labour came to power in if a may election is called there could be as little as days between the budget and the announcement of a date for the election a shortened finance bill would have to be rushed through parliament with all party support to allow the government to continue collecting revenue the full finance bill with the budget measures in it would then be returned to the commons after the election if labour secures another term in office tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said we can be sure of two things the budget will contain measures to attract votes and it will not contain the billion of tax rises which independent experts say are inevitable if labour wins the election as mr brown announced the budget date in a short ministerial statement accountancy firm ernst young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long term requirements of the economy in the budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and in many cases taxes were increased soon after the election result said aidan o carroll e y s uk head of tax

cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged gordon brown reallocated m from central to local government budgets in his pre budget report on thursday mr raynsford said he had held some pretty frank discussions with fellow ministers over the plans but he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises the central government cash is part of a bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year s council tax rises below in what is likely to be a general election year mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities and he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this he told bbc radio s the world at one but he said there was a recognition that a good settlement for local government was important to health education and other government departments ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without unreasonable council tax increases he added mr raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election this is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face mr raynsford also plans to make savings of m by making changes to local government pensions schemes these would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early he insisted the changes were very modest and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring very early but general secretary of the public services union unison dave prentis criticised the plans if you want world class public services you do n t get that by hitting people as they approach retirement
uk will stand firm on eu rebate britain s bn eu rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week s european council summit jack straw said the foreign secretary told mps the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in was entirely justified new european commission president jose manuel barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the eu budget mr straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged nation eu still had to see the light on the rebate but the foreign secretary told the commons foreign affairs committee our position is very clear it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation he added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the uk s stance britain contributed more and received less than other eu states the two day european council summit in brussels begins on december and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the eu s budget for the wrangling could stretch into even the uk france germany austria the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at of member states combined national incomes the commission wants it to be mr straw said the eu commission s proposal would mean a hike in the budget i do n t know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount he added the foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in for the beginning of negotiations with turkey about possible eu membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time
will the budget bring out smiling voters as tory spokesman oliver letwin said any chancellor would use his pre election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners would n t he and everyone does indeed expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of may there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week s budget the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories do n t desert him at the third poll and needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown s own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win but there is a shadow hanging over this pre election performance in the shape of billion or thereabouts that is the size of the financial black hole the tories backed by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash it was immediately denied but the tories remain suspicious claiming that as mr letwin said if the money does not come from there where will it come from mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should labour win previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong he will argue while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy low unemployment and high public spending the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same time the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election
budget to set scene for election gordon brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of labour s bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth budget at gmt he is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability with low unemployment and interest rates the chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from but the conservatives and lib dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means testing under labour treasury officials have said there will not be a pre election giveaway but mr brown is thought to have about bn to spare increase in the stamp duty threshold from a freeze on petrol duty an extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families possible help for pensioners the stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers a likely theme of all three of the main parties general election manifestos ten years ago buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty with close to half a million properties in england and wales alone selling for less than since then average uk property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased tax credits as a result the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government s tax take the liberal democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to in february the tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds with shadow chancellor oliver letwin branding stamp duty a classic labour stealth tax the tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if labour is returned to power shadow treasury chief secretary george osborne said everyone who looks at the british economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances that there is a black hole he said if labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the budget after the election of the order of around bn but mr brown s former advisor ed balls now a parliamentary hopeful said an examination of tory plans for the economy showed there would be a bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties he added i do n t accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments for the lib dems david laws said the chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing he said but a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way snp leader alex salmond said his party would introduce a grant for first time buyers reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing plaid cymru s economics spokesman adam price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to an hour
brown comes out shooting labour may have abolished hunting but that did n t stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes specifically it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families in a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre election boost everyone had been predicting so if you are a couple with children a pensioner a patient or a youngster there was something pulled from mr brown s red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government like a surgeon he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign the announcements brought great cheers from his own mps who are now in full on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps they obviously believed he had done that for them and coincidentally given his own image as a prime minister in waiting another little boost labour mps for example will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive a lovely old labour word this chancellor really is but gordon brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term his demeanour remained quiet confident and reassuring prudence made an appearance albeit towards the end of his address as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which he claimed would be thrown away by anyone else according to the opposition parties however it is all one big con trick as always they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which they claim would ensure tax increases after the election he did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claimed for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use he branded it a dodgy vote now pay later budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave britain the dodgy dossier where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown s forecasts to the prime minister s forecasts on iraq s weapons of mass destruction as ever there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor s red book which sets out the fine detail of his budget in an attempt to spot the flaws in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election
kennedy criticises unfair taxes gordon brown has failed to tackle the fundamental unfairness in the tax system in his ninth budget charles kennedy has said how was it right that the poorest of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest the lib dem leader asked the new council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the unfair tax he added the government could not go on patching up the system he added speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation the chancellor s announcement that he was to offer a council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a sticking plaster to a much bigger problem the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than a year with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off on pensions mr kennedy said it was a scandal that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children he said a residency criteria would end at a stroke this fundamental iniquity mr kennedy added his party s priorities of free long term care for the elderly abolishing top up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging income tax to those earning more than per annum he contrasted his approach with mr brown s pledge in not to increase income tax the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election for most individuals most families most households it adds up to exactly the same thing said mr kennedy and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election
howard attacks pay later budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as vote now pay later spending plans the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole mr howard said everyone could see the chancellor s sweeteners but these hid tax rises for hard working families he said labour s faltering election campaign would not be helped by the package of measures mr howard added mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country but all about the interests of the labour party the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging millions of people in to the net to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax we can all see the sweeteners but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard working families that are inevitable if labour wins he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste to get people to vote now and pay later mr brown liked to rattle off magical balances conjured out of thin air in a bid to convince people there was no black hole in the nation s finances the tory leader said this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers he said you now propose to borrow over the next six years no less than billion so much for prudence the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was less than what the tories were offering mr howard said there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools people would face a clear choice at the election either more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives he said that s the battleground of this election that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on he concluded to loud tory cheering

brown calls for bn aids fund gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund a bn bn plan to fight the aids epidemic and find a vaccine on the fourth day of his six day tour of africa the uk chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by if the world stepped up its funding pledges doubling the m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives mr brown said on thursday he hopes to use the uk s g presidency to push the issue forward i believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat cure and eradicate the world s deadliest disease of today and today the world s least curable disease hiv aids will rightly earn the title the great generation mr brown said in a speech during his african tour the problems of hiv aids were inseparable from poverty he added at least billion per annum bn is needed to address the hiv aids crisis in low and middle income countries existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic the uk s proposal for an international finance facility is so important increasing world aid flows by over billion bn a doubling of world aid to halve world poverty mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world wide sharing and co ordination of research into the disease currently the private sector was only spending m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting mr brown said he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first m vaccines at a cost of each thereby boosting the market for inoculations this would be a large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms mr brown added more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hiv aids and their families he said but aid charity actionaid criticised mr brown s preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on g nations to fund hiv aids treatments the charity s head of hiv aids in britain simon wright said while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important a failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns a generation of people to death hiv is decimating african countries killing the most productive adults who should be working caring for children and building the economy an hiv vaccine is probably at least years away treatments are needed now on wednesday mr brown visited slums in the kenyan capital nairobi he will visit an hiv aids orphanage in tanzania and a women s credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two
uk heading wrong way says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message mr blair s government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded britain is working do n t let the tories wreck it again mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice worst of all it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes we can have progress without losing what makes britain great its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential we simply need to change direction the election will give britain the chance to change this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account but labour spokesman mr kemp said it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on april not january let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax with labour britain is working rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country
act on detention ruling uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful mary robinson has said the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio s today the government s response would be scrutinised internationally it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it she said home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation mr clarke said i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year in the meantime we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords mrs robinson said the law lords ruling was in line with international legal opinion and praised their very decisive eight to one majority what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government but say that there had been a disproportionate use that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it did n t apply to british citizens she said mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords she said a meeting of the club of madrid a group of former world leaders to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti terrorism legislation in response to the september attacks in the us any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case
baa support ahead of court battle uk airport operator baa has reiterated its support for the government s aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country the comments come a day ahead of a high court challenge by residents groups and local councils to the government s white paper the judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at heathrow stansted and luton airports baa which operates all three said it was consulting with local communities we are consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations a baa spokesman said groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion heathrow anti noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth at heathrow gatwick edinburgh and glasgow airports baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september which will close next week the company is also offering to buy noise hit properties for an index linked unblighted price among other measures baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme at heathrow baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met at gatwick the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway stop stansted expansion said the white paper published in december was fundamentally flawed and did not follow the proper consultation process we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said hacan chairman john stewart said almost exactly a year ago the government published its year aviation white paper with much fanfare it hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation yet a year later the protesters are still here and stronger than ever a judgement from mr justice sullivan is expected early in february
uk discriminated against roma the government s immigration rules racially discriminated against roma gypsies seeking entry into the uk the law lords have ruled it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people mostly roma from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital prague civil rights group liberty said it exposed racism at the heart of the government s asylum policy the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone it said it would look at the implications of the ruling but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe the screening took place at the airport in july at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain those refused pre clearance were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk because no airline would carry them lady hale sitting with lords bingham steyn hope and carswell said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution but she said they were treated more sceptically than non roma passengers by immigration officers acting on racial grounds lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would be passengers in the same way only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non roma czechs it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain and that of the european roma rights centre which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people it lost a high court action in october when a judge said the system was no more or less objectionable than a visa control system he ruled there was no obligation on britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum the court of appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against roma but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries but it does not allow officers to go further than that responding to the ruling a home office spokesman said the scheme was operated two years ago as a short term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk welcoming the ruling maeve sherlock chief executive of the refugee council said human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group amnesty international s jan shaw said that the government s own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse not least in the czech republic but the chairman of migration watch uk sir andrew green said the house of lords decision was a step in the wrong direction the basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits
howard pitches for uk ethnic vote michael howard is to make a pitch for britain s ethnic vote urging people who feel taken for granted by tony blair to vote conservative he will say conservatives share the same values as the uk s minorities and that he wants to build a better britain where everyone whatever the colour of their skin or religion can make the most of their talents but the tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is outdated and unjust it sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities he will argue mr howard himself the son of immigrants will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the uk people from ethnic communities for example still earn less than their white counterparts he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was free enterprise free trade free speech the tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that hindus and sikhs as well as muslims got caught in the downdraft of islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of mr howard will make his speech during a visit to support tory parliamentary hopefuls robert light and sayeeda warsi the first british muslim woman selected to run for mp as a conservative candidate he will attack labour s record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by mps mr howard will also attack the lib dems for wanting to abolish faith schools introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven and give contraceptives out in schools from the age of so i say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel mr blair and the liberal democrats take their votes for granted come join us he will say lib dem president simon hughes branded mr howard arrogant and wrong for claiming the tories were the natural party for britain s ethnic minorities given the tories considerably reduced support in urban areas where many black and asian britons live during their time in power the evidence simply does not support his claims that the conservatives are the party for these communities he said

uk rebate unjustified chirac french president jacques chirac has called the uk s bn rebate from the european union unjustified speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the eu would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in he said it remained justified because less eu farm money came to the uk mr chirac told reporters in brussels one can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque it can no longer be justified it was from the past but a uk government official responded even with the rebate the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget without it we would pay times as much as france there can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate the member eu is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period with the bloc s luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a june summit earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a crucial test of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions the uk france germany austria the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at of member states combined national incomes the european commission has urged an increase to mr straw has said the eu commission s proposal would mean a hike in the budget shadow europe minister mr brady said i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think it s a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu the foreign secretary meanwhile said the justice of the rebate remained we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency that continues to be the case uk independence party leader roger knapman said the rebate was set in stone and there was no reason to negotiate about it it is extraordinary to do it at this time just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the eu if we lose our rebate as well the british taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that i think everyone will go off the european project eu leaders are holding talks in brussels on how to re energise the sluggish european economy uk prime minister tony blair is meeting his eu counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the european constitution the plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction critics including germany and france believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in eastern europe undercutting large eu economies and undermining social protections there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany mr straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods he said what we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services britain s low unemployment meant there was less neurosis about people coming from eastern european countries in countries like germany and france where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in he said

election could be terror target terrorists might try to target the uk in the run up to the election london s most senior police officer has said sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain s general election last year other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk s presidency of the european union and g he said he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre poll attack no was similarly cautious but said the threat was real the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti terror proposals warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be unwise to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre election attack but he said terrorists have long memories they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate this year we are responsible for the eu presidency presidency of the g a royal wedding and a general election there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with sir ian said the debate over anti terror plans was one for politicians not the police who would enforce any new powers home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid style pre election bombing could happen in the uk too asked about sir ian s comments the prime minister s official spokesman said we believe the threat is real the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign he said no did not disclose any security advice they received earlier writing in the daily telegraph the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were difficult issues for any government the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition with the government s majority more than halved as labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition but mr blair insisted there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of using national security for political point scoring liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour s authoritarian response to crises the prevention of terrorism bill proposes control orders which as well as house arrest could impose curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords

blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on may the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll it has not shifted over the weeks there have been any number of signs that was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour s stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster to underline that economic message and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties tax and spend policies during the phoney campaign labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning bn cuts in public services the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour s plans was a cut and it looked like the labour campaign which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health was on the rocks then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger cuts he was sacked for his gaffe but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track a second central argument will be over taxation with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again mr brown slaps that aside claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate as usual the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax other issues are certain to play a part immigration and asylum the war on iraq law and order and education for example but as ever it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome and whatever that outcome is set to be a far more lively even bitter campaign than s non event

abortion not a poll issue blair tony blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue arguing it is a matter for individual conscience the prime minister s spokesman set out mr blair s view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howard s stance on abortions the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from weeks to and has said current rules are tantamount to abortion on demand the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law mr blair s spokesman said the catholic church has a well known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context his words came as cardinal cormac murphy o connor the archbishop of westminster backed mr howard s stance and distanced himself from labour in a statement he said abortion was a very key issue saying the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend on the way to a full abandonment of abortion cardinal o connor claimed labour had developed the notion that it was the natural party of catholics but he said we are not going to suggest people support one particular party the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later more than women in england and wales had terminations last year of which fewer than were carried out between and weeks in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said i believe abortion should be available to everyone but the law should be changed in the past i voted for a restriction to weeks and i would be prepared to go down to all three main parties say the issue is one for each mp s conscience rather than one where there is a party wide policy mr howard stressed his views were his personal views shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews conducted as part of the magazine s high heeled vote campaign mr blair who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion said abortion was a difficult issue however much i dislike the idea of abortion you should not criminalise a woman who in very difficult circumstances makes that choice obviously there is a time beyond which you ca n t have an abortion and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a week limit but medical advances mean i do n t know what i would do now the roman catholic archbishop of cardiff the most reverend peter smith told bbc radio s today programme that the church merely wanted people to reflect on issues in light of the gospel before voting anne weyman chief executive of the family planning association asked what is the benefit to women or to the potential child of forcing a woman to have a baby anti abortion group the pro life alliance congratulated mr howard on his new stance but said it did not go far enough
profile gordon brown the ultimate prize of downing street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver a record breaking ninth budget gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times he reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and days between and how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors or politicians before him gordon brown was born in glasgow on february the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy at he was canvassing for labour and by his s he was a leading political activist in scotland he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete a phd his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party his first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael ancram but in he took dunfermline east a new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal towns entering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony blair within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury he became shadow chancellor under john smith s leadership in after the death of leader john smith in he stood aside agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington the other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend mr blair s supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns and even a television film have been devoted to the alleged deal but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in mr brown continued his devotion to politics during the election campaign he is said to have worked an average of hours a day six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown s former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of ex king michael of romania who said a relationship with him was politics politics politics if that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary days after being born seven weeks prematurely a year later in october the couple had a son john an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side a trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute after a recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brown blair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown using the budget as a springboard is to revitalise labour s campaign amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown including mr milburn but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can and mr blair s decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for even if the prime minister s intention to serve a full third term if elected took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters

howard s unfinished business he s not finished yet whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall and indeed he was n t michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech at his party s spring conference in brighton to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain s description of him as an attack mongrel claiming such personal abuse meant labour was rattled by the tory challenge and here he was again moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause to make a personal ad libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory one day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as i will tell mine i was there i did my bit i played my part i helped to win that famous election the election that transformed our country for the better the speech which was peppered with references to mr howard s humble beginnings as the child of immigrants had been introduced by his son nick a trainee vicar who praised his father s honesty i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me he said mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra daughter larissa and stepson sholto the audience s reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards but mr howard s overall message that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago mr howard claimed with some justification that the tories campaign has got off to a great start they have had labour on the back foot over immigration with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her son s special needs education may not have been to everyone s taste but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react senior tories believe they are at long last starting to tap into the public mood cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline cleaner hospitals i mean how hard is it to keep a hospital clean and immigration it s not racist to impose limits on immigration under the headline are you thinking what we are thinking this they say contrasts with labour s negative campaigning such as its now infamous flying pigs poster oliver letwin one of the men lampooned in the labour poster affects bewilderment at what he believes is labour s loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail the peter hain mongrel attack he says is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong a by product he claims of the tories setting the agenda i have to say i do n t understand what they are doing the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock it does n t seem to know what to do a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists morale likely to be a crucial factor at an election which most analysts seem to agree will hinge on which party can get their core support out it has been a fantastic few weeks said year old politics student nick vaughan our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win i would n t be here if i did n t think we could some delegates even spoke of the next election being like when ted heath behind in the polls and written off by the pundits snatched victory from harold wilson s labour party they all insisted it was not going to be a re run of we thought in we were going to dent that massive majority but it just did n t happen said john murray of aldridge browhills conservatives it was very disappointing this time it really is different whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on blair is on the back foot much of the credit for the tories recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no hoper john howard of australia s liberal party into a serial election winner the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls they are still behind when to have a chance of overturning labour s whopping majority they should really be ahead but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper the party at least has reason to hope that like his australian namesake mr howard really is n t finished yet
